  <h2 class='c005'>TRANSLATOR’S NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That humanity is seeking a new message, a new light
upon the meaning of life, and something tangible, as it
were, with which it can work towards a larger understanding
of itself and its relation to the universe, is a
fact I think none will gainsay. Therefore, it has
seemed to me particularly timely to introduce to the English-speaking
world Dr. Jung’s remarkable book, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wandlungen
und Symbole der Libido.</span>” In this work he has
plunged boldly into the treacherous sea of mythology and
folklore, the productions of the ancient mind and that of
the common people, and turned upon this vast material
the same scientific and painstaking method of psychologic
analysis that is applied to the modern mind, in order to
reveal the common bond of desire and longing which
unites all humanity, and thus bridge the gaps presumed
to exist between ancient and widely separated peoples and
those of our modern time. The discovery of this undercurrent
affecting and influencing ancient peoples as well
as modern serves as a foundation or platform from which
he proceeds to hold aloft a new ideal, a new goal of
attainment possible of achievement and which can be intellectually
satisfying, as well as emotionally appealing:
the goal of <em>moral autonomy</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This book, remarkable for its erudition and the tremendous
labor expended upon it, as well as for the new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>light which it sheds upon human life, its motives, its
needs and its possibilities, is not one for desultory reading
or superficial examination. Such an approach will
prevent the reader from gaining anything of its real
value; but for those who can bring a serious interest and
willingness to give a careful study to it the work will
prove to be a veritable mine capable of yielding the
greatest riches.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulties in translating a book such as this are
almost insuperable, but I have tried faithfully to express
Dr. Jung’s thought, keeping as close to the original text
as possible and, at the same time, rendering the difficult
material and complicated German phrasing as simply and
clearly as the subject-matter would allow. In all this
work I owe much to Miss Helen I. Brayton, without
whose faithful assistance the work would never have been
completed. I wish to acknowledge my gratitude to Mr.
Louis Untermeyer, whose help in rendering the poetic
quotations into English verse has been invaluable, and to
express as well my gratitude to other friends who have
assisted me in various ways from time to time.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>AN INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOANALYSIS AND ANALYTIC PSYCHOLOGY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When Professor Freud of Vienna made his early
discoveries in the realm of the neuroses, and announced
that the basis and origin of the various symptoms
grouped under the terms hysteria and neuroses lay in
unfulfilled desires and wishes, unexpressed and unknown
to the patient for the most part, and concerned chiefly
with the sexual instinct, it was not realized what far-reaching
influence this unpopular and bitterly attacked
theory would exert on the understanding of human life
in general.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this theory has so widened in its scope that its
application has now extended beyond a particular group
of pathologic states. It has in fact led to a new evaluation
of the whole conduct of human life; a new comprehension
has developed which explains those things which
formerly were unexplained, and there is offered an
understanding not only of the symptoms of a neurosis
and the phenomena of conduct but the product of the
mind as expressed in myths and religions.</p>

<p class='c007'>This amazing growth has proceeded steadily in an
ever-widening fashion despite opposition as violent as
any of which we have knowledge in the past. The criticism
originally directed towards the little understood and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>much disliked sexual conception now includes the further
teachings of a psychology which by the application to it
of such damning phrases as mystical, metaphysical and
sacrilegious, is condemned as unscientific.</p>

<p class='c007'>To add to the general confusion and misunderstanding
surrounding this new school of thought there has arisen
a division amongst the leaders themselves, so that there
now exist two schools led respectively by Professor
Sigmund Freud of Vienna and Dr. Carl Jung of Zurich,
referred to in the literature as the Vienna School and
the Zurich School.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very easy to understand that criticism and opposition
should develop against a psychology so difficult of
comprehension, and so disturbing to the ideas which have
been held by humanity for ages; a psychology which
furthermore requires a special technique as well as an
observer trained to recognize and appreciate in psychologic
phenomena a verification of the statement that
there is no such thing as chance, and that every act and
every expression has its own meaning, determined by the
inner feelings and wishes of the individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not a simple matter to come out boldly and state
that every individual is to a large extent the determiner
of his own destiny, for only by poets and philosophers
has this idea been put forth—not by science; and it is a
brave act to make this statement with full consciousness
of all its meaning, and to stand ready to prove it by
scientific reasoning and procedure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Developed entirely through empirical investigation and
through an analysis of individual cases, Freudian psychology
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>seems particularly to belong to that conception
of Max Müller’s that “An empirical acquaintance with
facts rises to a scientific knowledge of facts as soon as
the mind discovers beneath the multiplicity of single
productions the unity of an organic system.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Psychoanalysis is the name given to the method developed
for reaching down into the hidden depths of the
individual to bring to light the underlying motives and
determinants of his symptoms and attitudes, and to reveal
the unconscious tendencies which lie behind actions and
reactions and which influence development and determine
the relations of life itself. The result of digging down
into the hidden psyche has been to produce a mass of
material from below the threshold of consciousness, so
astonishing and disturbing and out of relation with the
previously held values, as to arouse in any one unfamiliar
with the process the strongest antagonism and criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although originally studied only as a therapeutic
method for the sick it was soon realized through an
analysis of normal people how slight were the differences
in the content of the unconscious of the sick and of the
normal. The differences observed were seen to be rather
in the reactions to life and to the conflicts produced by
contending forces in the individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>These conflicts, usually not fully perceived by the individual,
and having to do with objectionable desires and
wishes that are not in keeping with the conscious idea of
self, produce marked effects which are expressed either
in certain opinions, prejudices, attitudes of conduct,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>faulty actions, or in some definite pathologic symptom.
As Dr. Jung says, he who remains healthy has to struggle
with the same complexes that cause the neurotic to fall ill.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a valuable book called “The Neighbor,” written
by the late Professor N. Shaler of Harvard University,
there occurs this very far-reaching statement: “It is
hardly too much to say that all the important errors of
conduct, all the burdens of men or of societies are caused
by the inadequacies in the association of the primal animal
emotions with those mental powers which have been so
rapidly developed in mankind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This statement, reached by a process of reasoning
and a method of thought and study entirely different
from psychoanalysis, nevertheless so completely expresses
in brief form the very basis of the postulates
developed through psychoanalysis that I quote it here.
Such a statement made in the course of a general examination
of human relations does not arouse opposition nor
seem to be so difficult of acceptance. It appears to be
the individual application of these conceptions that has
roused such bitter antagonism and violent denunciations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rightly understood and used, psychoanalysis may be
compared to surgery, for psychoanalysis stands in the
same relation to the personality as surgery does to the
body, and they aim at parallel results.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well recognized that in the last analysis nature is
the real physician, the healer of wounds; but prior to the
development of our modern asepsis and surgical technique
the healing produced by nature was most often of a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>faulty and imperfect type—hideous scars, distorted and
crippled limbs, with functions impaired or incapacitated,
resulted from the wounds, or else nature was unable to
cope with the hurt and the injured one succumbed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Science has been steadily working for centuries with
the aim of understanding nature and finding means to
aid and co-operate with her so that healing could take
place with the least possible loss of function or permanent
injury to the individual. Marvelous results have rewarded
these persistent efforts, as the brilliant achievements
of surgery plainly indicate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime, however, little thought was given to the
possibility of any scientific method being available to help
man overcome the wounds and conflicts taking place in
his soul, hurts which retarded his development and progress
as a personality, and which frequently in the struggle
resulted in physical pains and symptoms of the most
varied character. That was left solely to religion and
metaphysics. Now, however, this same assistance that
surgery has given to the physical body, psychoanalysis
attempts to give to the personality. That it cannot
always succeed is as much to be expected, and more,
than that surgery does not always succeed, for the
analytic work requires much of the individual. No
real result can be attained if he has not already
developed a certain quality of character and intelligence
which makes it possible for him to submit
himself to a facing of his naked soul, and to the pain and
suffering which this often entails. Here, as in no other
relation in life, an absolute truth and an absolute honesty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>are the only basis of action, since deception of any kind
deceives no one but the individual himself and acts as a
boomerang, defeating his own aims.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such deep searching and penetrating into the soul is
not something to be undertaken lightly nor to be considered
a trivial or simple matter, and the fact is that
where a strong compulsion is lacking, such as sickness
or a situation too difficult to meet, much courage is
required to undertake it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to understand this psychology which is pervading
all realms of thought and seems destined to be a
new psychological-philosophical system for the understanding
and practical advancement of human life, it will
be necessary to go somewhat into detail regarding its
development and present status. For in this new direction
lies its greatest value and its greatest danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beginnings of this work were first published in
1895 in a book entitled “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Studien über Hysterie</span>,” and
contained the joint investigations into hysteria of Dr.
Breuer of Vienna and his pupil Dr. Sigmund Freud. The
results of their investigations seemed to show that the
various symptoms grouped under the title of hysteria
were the result of emotionally colored reminiscences
which, all unknown to the conscious waking self, were
really actively expressing themselves through the surrogate
form of symptoms and that these experiences, although
forgotten by the patient, could be reproduced
and the emotional content discharged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hypnosis was the means used to enable the physician
to penetrate deeply into the forgotten memories, for it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>was found through hypnosis that these lost incidents and
circumstances were not really lost at all but only dropped
from consciousness, and were capable of being revived
when given the proper stimuli. The astonishing part
about it was that with the revival of these memories and
their accompanying painful and disturbing emotions, the
symptoms disappeared. This led naturally to the conclusion
that these symptoms were dependent upon some
emotional disturbance or psychic trauma which had been
inadequately expressed, and that in order to cure the
patient one merely had to establish the connection between
the memory and the emotions which properly
belonged to it, letting the emotion work itself out through
a reproduction of the forgotten scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>With further investigation Freud found that hypnosis
was unnecessary for the revival of the forgotten experiences,
and that it was possible to obtain the lost emotional
material in the conscious and normal state. For this
purpose the patient was encouraged to assume a passive,
non-critical attitude and simply let his thoughts flow,
speaking of whatever came into his mind, holding nothing
back. During this free and easy discussion of his life
and conditions, directed by the law of association of
ideas, reference was invariably made to the experiences
or thoughts which were the most affective and disturbing
elements. It was seen to be quite impossible to avoid
this indirect revelation because of the strength of the
emotions surrounding these ideas and the effect of the
conscious wish to repress unpleasant feelings. This important
group of ideas or impressions, with the feelings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>and emotions clustered around them which are betrayed
through this process, was called by Jung a <em>complex</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, with the touching of the <em>complex</em> which
always contains feelings and emotions so painful or unpleasant
as to be unacceptable to consciousness, and which
are therefore repressed and hidden, great difficulties appeared,
for very often the patient came to a sudden stop
and could apparently recall nothing more. Memory
gaps were frequent, relations twisted, etc. Evidently
some force banished these memories so that the person
was quite honest in saying that he could remember nothing
or that there was nothing to tell. This kind of forgetfulness
was called <em>repression</em>, and is the normal
mechanism by which nature protects the individual from
such painful feelings as are caused by unpleasant and unacceptable
experiences and thoughts, the recognition of
his egoistic nature, and the often quite unbearable conflict
of his weaknesses with his feelings of idealism.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this early time great attention was given towards
developing a technique which would render more easy
the reproduction of these forgotten memories, for with
the abandonment of hypnosis it was seen that some unknown
active force was at work which not only banished
painful memories and feelings, but also prevented their
return; this was called <em>resistance</em>. This resistance
was found to be the important mechanism which interfered
with a free flow of thought and produced the
greatest difficulty in the further conduct of the analysis.
It appeared under various guises and frequently manifested
itself in intellectual objections based on reasoning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>ground, in criticism directed towards the analyst, or in
criticism of the method itself, and finally, often in a complete
blocking of expression, so that until the resistance
was broken nothing more could be produced.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was necessary then to find some aid by which these
resistances could be overcome and the repressed memories
and feelings revived and set free. For it was proven
again and again that even though the person was not at
all aware of concealing within himself some emotionally
disturbing feeling or experience with which his symptoms
were associated, yet such was the fact, and that under
proper conditions this material could be brought into
consciousness. This realm where these unknown but disturbing
emotions were hidden was called the “Unconscious”—the
“Unconscious” also being a name used
arbitrarily to indicate all that material of which the person
is not aware at the given time—the not-conscious.</p>

<p class='c007'>This term is used very loosely in Freudian psychology
and is not intended to provoke any academic discussion
but to conform strictly to the dictionary classification of
a “negative concept which can neither be described nor
defined.” To say that an idea or feeling is unconscious
merely means to indicate that the individual is unaware
at that time of its existence, or that all the material of
which he is unaware at a given time is unconscious.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the discovery of the significance in relation to
hysteria of these varied experiences and forgotten memories
which always led into the erotic realm and usually
were carried far back into early childhood, the theory of
an infantile sexual trauma as a cause of this neurosis developed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>Contrary to the usual belief that children have
no sexuality and that only at puberty does it suddenly
arise, it was definitely shown that there was a very marked
kind of sexuality among children of the most tender years,
entirely instinctive and capable of producing a grave effect
on the entire later life.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, further investigations carried into the lives
of normal people disclosed quite as many psychic and
sexual traumas in their early childhood as in the lives of
the patients; therefore, the conception of the “infantile
sexual trauma” as the etiological factor was abandoned
in favor of “the infantilism of sexuality” itself. In
other words, it was soon realized that many of the sexual
traumas which were placed in their early childhood by
these patients, did not really exist except in their own
phantasies and probably were produced as a defence
against the memories of their own childish sexual activities.
These experiences led to a deep investigation into
the nature of the child’s sexuality and developed the
ideas which Freud incorporated in a work called “Three
Contributions to the Sexual Theory.” He found so
many variations and manifestations of sexual activity
even among young children that he realized that this
activity was the normal, although entirely unconscious,
expression of the child’s developing life, and while not
comparable to the adult sexuality, nevertheless produced
a very definite influence and effect on the child’s
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>These childish expressions of this instinct he called
“polymorphous perverse,” because in many ways they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>resembled the various abnormalities called perversions
when found among adults under certain conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the light of these additional investigations Freud
was led to change his formulation, for instead of the
symptoms of the neurotic patient being due to definite
sexual experiences, they seemed to be determined by
his reactions towards his own sexual constitution and
the kind of repression to which these instincts were
subjected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps one of the greatest sources of misunderstanding
and difficulty in this whole subject lies in the term
sexuality, for Freud’s conception of this is entirely different
from that of the popular sense. He conceives
sexuality to be practically synonymous with the word
<em>love</em> and to include under this term all those tender
feelings and emotions which have had their origin in a
primitive erotic source, even if now their primary aim is
entirely lost and another substituted for it. It must also
be borne in mind that Freud strictly emphasizes the
psychic side of sexuality and its importance, as well as
the somatic expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore, to understand Freud’s theories, his very
broad conception of the term sexual must never be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through this careful investigation of the psychic life
of the individual, the tremendous influence and importance
of phantasy-making for the fate was definitely
shown. It was discovered that the indulgence in day-dreams
and phantasies was practically universal not only
among children but among adults, that even whole lives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>were being lived out in a phantastic world created by the
dreamer, a world wherein he could fulfil all those wishes
and desires which were found to be too difficult or impossible
to satisfy in the world of reality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much of this phantasy thinking was seen to be scarcely
conscious, but arose from unrealized wishes, desires and
strivings which could only express themselves through
veiled symbols in the form of phantastic structures not
understood, nor fully recognized. Indeed, it is perhaps
one of the most common human experiences to find
“queer thoughts,” undesired ideas and images, forcing
themselves upon one’s attention to such an extent that
the will has to be employed to push them out of mind.
It is not unusual to discover long-forgotten impressions
of childhood assuming a phantastic shape in memory, and
dwelt upon as though they were still of importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>This material afforded a rich field for the searchers
into the soul, for through the operation of the law of
association of ideas these phantastic products, traced back
to their origin, revealed the fact that instead of being
meaningless or foolish, they were produced by a definite
process, and arose from distinct wishes and desires which
unconsciously veiled themselves in these mysterious forms
and pictures.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is conceded that the most completely unconscious
product of an individual is his dream, and therefore Professor
Freud turned his attention from phantasies and
day-dreams to the investigation of the nightly dreams of
his patients to discover whether they would throw light
upon the painful feelings and ideas repressed out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>consciousness, and therefore inaccessible to direct revelation.</p>

<p class='c007'>This brilliant idea soon led to a rich fruiting, for it
became evident that contrary to the usual conception that
the dream is a phantastic and absurd jumble of heterogeneous
fragments, having no real relation to the life of
the individual, it is full of meaning. In fact, it is usually
concerned with the problem of life most pressing at the
time, which expresses itself not directly, but in symbolic
form so as to be unrecognized. In this way the individual
gains an expression and fulfilment of his unrealized wish
or desire.</p>

<p class='c007'>This discovery of the symbolic nature of the dream
and the phantasy was brought about entirely through the
associative method and developed empirically through
investigations of the dreams of many people. In this
manner it became evident that certain ideas and objects
which recurred again and again in the dreams and phantasies
of different people were definitely associated with
certain unconscious or unrecognized wishes and desires,
and were repeatedly used by the mind to express these
meanings where a direct form was repressed and unallowed.
Thus certain dream expressions and figures
were in a general way considered to be rather definite
symbols of these repressed ideas and feelings found in
the unconscious. Through a comparative and parallel
study it soon appeared that there was a similar mechanism
at work in myths and fairy tales and that the relationship
between the dreams and phantasies of an individual
and the myths and folk tales of a people was so close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>that Abraham could say that the myth is a fragment
of the infantile soul life of the race and the dream is
the myth of the individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus through relating his dreams the patient himself
furnished the most important means of gaining access to
the unconscious and disturbing complexes with which his
symptoms were connected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the dream analysis the patient furnished other
means of revelation of his complexes—his mannerisms
and unconscious acts, his opening remarks to his physician,
his emotional reactions to certain ideas; in short the whole
behavior and verbal expressions of the individual reveal
his inner nature and problems.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through all this work it became clear that in the
emotional nature lay the origin not only of the various
nervous illnesses themselves, but also of the isolated
symptoms and individual idiosyncrasies and peculiarities
which are the part of all humanity and that the pathogenic
cause of the disturbances lies not in the ignorance
of individuals, but in those inner resistances which are the
underlying basis of this ignorance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore the aim of the therapy became not merely
the relief of the ignorance but the searching out and combating
of these resistances.</p>

<p class='c007'>It becomes evident from even this brief description
of the analytic procedure that we are dealing with a very
complex and delicate material, and with a technique which
needs to make definite use of all influences available for
the help of the patient. It has long been recognized
that the relation established between physician and patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>has a great effect upon the medical assistance which
he is able to render—in other words, if a confidence and
personal regard developed in the patient towards the
physician, the latter’s advice was just so much more
efficacious. This personal feeling has been frankly recognized
and made of distinct service in psychoanalytic treatment
under the name of <em>transference</em>. It is through
the aid of this definite relationship which must be
established in the one being analyzed towards the analyst
that it is possible to deal with the unconscious and
organized resistances which so easily blind the individual
and render the acceptance of the new valuations very
difficult to the raw and sensitive soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>Freud’s emphasis upon the rôle of the sexual instinct
in the production of the neurosis and also in its determining
power upon the personality of the normal individual
does not imply that he does not also recognize other
determinants at the root of human conduct, as for
instance, the instinct for preservation of life and the ego
principle itself. But these motives are not so violently
forbidden and repressed as the sexual impulse, and therefore,
because of that repressive force and the strength
of the impulse he considers this primary in its influence
upon the human being.</p>

<p class='c007'>The importance of this instinct upon human life is
clearly revealed by the great place given to it under the
name of love in art, literature, poetry, romance and all
beauty from the beginning of recorded time. Viewed in
this light it cannot seem extraordinary that a difficulty
or disturbance in this emotional field should produce such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>far-reaching consequences for the individual. The sexual
impulse is often compared with that of hunger, and this
craving and need lying in all humanity is called by Freud
<em>libido</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>The Oedipus Problem</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>With further investigations into the nature of the
repressed complexes a very astonishing situation was
revealed. The parental influence on children is something
so well recognized and understood that to call attention
to it sounds much like a banality. However, here
an extraordinary discovery was made, for in tracing out
the feelings and emotions of adults it became evident
that this influence was paramount not only for children
but for adults as well; that the entire direction of lives
was largely determined quite unconsciously by the parental
associations, and that, although adults, the emotional
side of their nature was still infantile in type and
demanded unconsciously the infantile or childish relations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Freud traces out the commencement of the infantile
attachment for the parents in this wise.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the beginning the child derives its first satisfaction
and pleasure from the mother in the form of nutrition
and care for its wants. In this first act of suckling Freud
sees already a kind of sexual pleasure, for he apparently
identifies the pleasure principle and the sexual instinct
and considers that the former is primarily rooted in the
latter. At this early time commence such various infantile
actions unconnected with nutrition as thumbsucking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>various movements of the body as rubbing, boring,
pulling and other manifestations of a definite interest in
its own body, a delight in nakedness, the pleasure exhibited
in inflicting pain on some object and its opposite,
the pleasure from receiving pain. All of these afford the
child pleasure and satisfaction, and because they seem
analogous to certain perversions in adults they are called
by Freud the “polymorphous perverse sexuality” of
childhood. The character of these instinctive actions
which have nothing to do with any other person, and
through which the child attains pleasure from its own
body, caused Freud to term this phase of life as autoerotic
after Havelock Ellis. However, with the growth
of the child there is a parallel development of the psychic
elements of its sexual nature and now the mother, the
original object of its love, primarily determined by its
helplessness and need, acquires a new valuation. The
beginnings of the need for a love object to satisfy the
craving or libido of the child are early in evidence and,
following along sex lines in general, the little son prefers
the mother and the daughter the father after the usual
preference of the parents.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this early time children feel deeply the enormous
importance of their parents and their entire world is
bounded by the family circle. All the elements of the
ego which the child possesses have now become manifest;
love, jealousy, curiosity, hate, etc., and those instincts
are directed in the greatest degree towards the objects
of their libido, namely the parents. With the growing
ego of the child there is a development of strong wishes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>and desires demanding satisfaction which can only be
gratified by the mother; therefore there is aroused in
the small son the feeling of jealousy and anger towards
the father in whom he sees a rival for the affection of
the mother and whom he would like to replace. This
desire in the soul of the child Freud calls the <em>Oedipus
complex</em> in recognition of its analogy to the tragedy
of King Oedipus who was drawn by his fate to kill his
father and win his mother for a wife. Freud presents
this as the <em>nuclear complex</em> of every neurosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the basis of this complex, some trace of which can
be found in every person, Freud sees a definite incest wish
towards the mother which only lacks the quality of consciousness.
Because of moral reactions this wish is
quickly subjected to repression through the operation of
the “incest barrier,” a postulate he compares to the incest
taboo found among inferior peoples. At this time the
child is beginning to develop its typical sexual curiosity
expressed by the question, “Where do I come from?”
The interest and investigation of the child into this problem,
aided by observations and deductions from various
actions and attitudes of the parents, who have no idea
of the watchfulness of the child, lead him, because of his
imperfect knowledge and immature development, into
many false theories and ideas of birth. These infantile
sexual theories are held by Freud to be determinative in
the development of the child’s character and also for the
contents of the unconscious as expressed in a future
neurosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>These various reactions of the child and his sexual curiosity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>are entirely normal and unavoidable, and if his
development proceeds in an orderly fashion then, at the
time of definite object choice he will pass smoothly over
from the limitations of the family attachment out into
the world and find therein his independent existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, if the libido remains fixed on the first chosen
object so that the growing individual is unable to tear
himself loose from these familial ties, then the incestuous
bond is deepened with the developing sexual instinct and
its accompanying need of a love object, and the entire
future of the young personality endangered. For with
the development of the incestuous bond the natural repressions
deepen because the moral censor cannot allow
these disturbing relations to become clear to the individual.
Therefore, the whole matter is repressed more
deeply into the unconscious, and even a feeling of positive
enmity and repulsion towards the parents is often
developed in order to conceal and over-compensate for
the impossible situation actually present.</p>

<p class='c007'>This persistence of the attachment of the libido to the
original object, and the inability to find in this a suitable
satisfaction for the adult need, interferes with the normal
development of the psycho-sexual character, and it is due
to this that the adult retains that “infantilism of sexuality”
which plays so great a rôle in determining the instability
of the emotional life which so frequently leads
into the definite neuroses.</p>

<p class='c006'>These were the conclusions reached and the ground on
which Freudian psychology rested, regarding the etiology
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>of the neurosis, and the tendencies underlying normal
human mechanisms, when Dr. Carl Jung, the most prominent
of Freud’s disciples, and the leader of the Zurich
school, found himself no longer able to agree with
Freud’s findings in certain particulars, although the
phenomena which Freud observed and the technique of
psychoanalysis developed by Freud were the material on
which Jung worked and the value of which he clearly
emphasizes. The differences which have developed lay
in his understanding and interpretation of the phenomena
observed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beginning with the conception of libido itself as a
term used to connote sexual hunger and craving, albeit
the meaning of the word sexual was extended by Freud
to embrace a much wider significance than common usage
has assigned it, Jung was unable to confine himself to
this limitation. He conceived this longing, this urge or
push of life as something extending beyond sexuality even
in its wider sense. He saw in the term libido a concept
of unknown nature, comparable to Bergson’s élan vital,
a hypothetical energy of life, which occupies itself not
only in sexuality but in various physiological and psychological
manifestations such as growth, development,
hunger, and all the human activities and interests. This
cosmic energy or urge manifested in the human being he
calls libido and compares it with the energy of physics.
Although recognizing, in common with Freud as well as
with many others, the primal instinct of reproduction as
the basis of many functions and present-day activities of
mankind no longer sexual in character he repudiates the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>idea of still calling them sexual, even though their development
was a growth originally out of the sexual.
Sexuality and its various manifestations Jung sees as most
important channels occupied by libido, but not the exclusive
ones through which libido flows.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is an energic concept of life; and from this viewpoint
this hypothetical energy of life or libido is a living
power used instinctively by man in all the automatic
processes of his functioning; such very processes being
but different manifestations of this energy. By virtue
of its quality of mobility and change man, through his
understanding and intelligence, has the power consciously
to direct and use his libido in definite and desired ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this conception of Jung will be seen an analogy to
Bergson, who speaks of “this change, this movement and
becoming, this self-creation, call it what you will, as the
very stuff and reality of our being.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In developing the energic conception of libido and
separating it from Freud’s sexual definition, Jung makes
possible the explanation of interest in general, and provides
a working concept by which not only the specifically
sexual, but the general activities and reactions of man can
be understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a person complains of no longer having interest in
his work or of losing interest in his surroundings, then one
understands that his libido is withdrawn from this object
and that in consequence the object itself seems no longer
attractive, whereas, as a matter of fact, the object itself
is exactly the same as formerly. In other words, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>the libido that we bestow upon an object that makes it
attractive and interesting.</p>

<p class='c007'>The causes for the withdrawal of libido may be various
and are usually quite different from those that the persons
offer in explanation. It is the task of psychoanalysis to
discover the real reasons, which are usually hidden and
unknown. On the other hand, when an individual exhibits
an exaggerated interest or places an over-emphasis
upon an idea or situation, then we know there is too much
libido here and that we may find as a consequence a corresponding
depletion elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>This leads directly into the second point of difference
between Jung’s views and those of Freud. This is concerned
with those practically universal childish manifestations
of sexuality called by Freud “polymorphous
perverse” because of their similarity to those abnormalities
of sexuality which occur in adults and are called
perversions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jung takes exception to this viewpoint. He sees in the
various manifestations of childhood the precursors or
forerunners of the later fully developed sexuality, and
instead of considering them perverse he considers them
preliminary expressions of sexual coloring. He divides
human life into three stages. The first stage up to about
the third or fourth year, generally speaking, he calls the
presexual stage, for there he sees the libido or life
energy occupied chiefly in the functions of nutrition and
growth, and he draws an analogy between this period and
that of the caterpillar stage of the butterfly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second stage includes the years from this time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>until puberty, and this he speaks of as the prepubertal
stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third period is that from puberty onward and can
be considered the time of maturity.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in the earliest stage, the period of which varies
greatly in different individuals, that are fully inaugurated
those various manifestations which have so marked a
sexual coloring that there can be no question of their
relationship, although at that time sexuality in the adult
meaning of the word does not exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jung explains the polymorphism of these phenomena
as arising from a gradual movement of the libido from
exclusive service in the function of nutrition into new
avenues which successively open up with the development
of the child until the final inauguration of the sexual function
proper at puberty. Normally these childish bad
habits are gradually relinquished until the libido is entirely
withdrawn from these immature phases and with
the ushering in of puberty for the first time “appears in
the form of an undifferentiated sexual primitive power,
clearly forcing the individual towards division, budding,
etc.”</p>

<p class='c007'>However, if in the course of its movement from the
function of nutrition to the sexual function the libido is
arrested or retarded at any phase, then a <em>fixation</em> may
result, creating a disturbance in the harmony of the
normal development. For, although the libido is retarded
and remains clinging to some childish manifestation,
time goes on and the physical growth of the child
does not stand still. Soon a great contrast is created
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>between the infantile manifestations of the emotional
life and the needs of the more adult individual, and the
foundation is thus prepared for either the development
of a definite neurosis or else for those weaknesses of
character or symptomatic disturbances which are not
sufficiently serious to be called a neurosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most active and important forms of childish
libido occupation is in phantasy making. The child’s
world is one of imagery and make-believe where he can
create for himself that satisfaction and enjoyment which
the world of reality so often denies. As the child grows
and real demands of life are made upon him it becomes
increasingly necessary that his libido be taken away from
his phantastic world and used for the required adaptation
to reality needed by his age and condition, until finally
for the adult the freedom of the whole libido is necessary
to meet the biological and cultural demands of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of thus employing the libido in the real world,
however, certain people never relinquish the seeking for
satisfaction in the shadowy world of phantasy and even
though they make certain attempts at adaptation they
are halted and discouraged by every difficulty and obstacle
in the path of life and are easily pulled back into
their inner psychic world. This condition is called a
state of <em>introversion</em>. It is concerned with the past and
the reminiscences which belong thereto. Situations and
experiences which should have been completed and finished
long ago are still dwelt upon and lived with.
Images and matters which were once important but which
normally have no significance for their later age are still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>actively influencing their present lives. The nature and
character of these phantasy products are legion, and are
easily recognized in the emotional attitudes and pretensions,
the childish illusions and exaggerations, the prejudices
and inconsistencies which people express in manifold
forms. The actual situation is inadequately faced;
small matters are reacted towards in an exaggerated
manner; or else a frivolous attitude is maintained where
real seriousness is demanded. In other words, there is
clearly manifested an inadequate psychic adaptation towards
reality which is quite to be expected from the
child, but which is very discordant in the adult.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important of these past influences is that of
the parents. Because they are the first objects of the
developing childish love, and afford the first satisfaction
and pleasure to the child, they become the models for all
succeeding efforts, as Freud has worked out. This he
called the <em>nuclear</em> or <em>root complex</em> because this influence
was so powerful it seemed to be the determining factor
in all later difficulties in the life of the individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this phase of the problem lies the third great difference
between Jung’s interpretation of the observed
phenomena and that of Freud.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jung definitely recognizes that there are many neurotic
persons who clearly exhibited in their childhood the same
neurotic tendencies that are later exaggerated. Also that
an almost overwhelming effect on the destiny of these
children is exercised by the influence of the parents, the
frequent over-anxiety or tenderness, the lack of sympathy
or understanding, in other words, the complexes of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>parent reacting upon the child and producing in him love,
admiration, fear, distrust, hate, revolt. The greater the
sensitiveness and impressionability of the child, the more
he will be stamped with the familial environment, and
the more he will unconsciously seek to find again in the
world of reality the model of his own small world with
all the pleasures and satisfactions, or disappointments
and unhappinesses with which it was filled.</p>

<p class='c007'>This condition to be sure is not a recognized or a
conscious one, for the individual may think himself perfectly
free from this past influence because he is living in
the real world, and because actually there is a great difference
between the present conditions and that of his
childish past. He sees all this, intellectually, but there is
a wide gap between the intellectual grasp of a situation
and the emotional development, and it is the latter
realm wherein lies the disharmony. However, although
many ideas and feelings are connected with the parents,
analysis reveals very often that they are only subjective
and that in reality they bear little resemblance to the actual
past situation. Therefore, Jung speaks no longer of the
real father and mother but uses the term imago or image
to represent the father or mother, because the feelings
and phantasies frequently do not deal with the real
parents but with the distorted and subjective image
created by the imagination of the individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>Following this distinction Jung sees in the Oedipus
complex of Freud only a symbol for the “childish desire
towards the parents and for the conflict which this
craving evokes,” and cannot accept the theory that in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>early stage of childhood the mother has any real sexual
significance for the child.</p>

<p class='c007'>The demands of the child upon the mother, the
jealousy so often exhibited, are at first connected with
the rôle of the mother as protector, caretaker and supplier
of nutritive wants, and only later, with the germinating
eroticism, does the child’s love become admixed with
the developing sexual quality. The chief love objects are
still the parents and he naturally continues to seek and
to find in them satisfaction for all his desires. In this
way the typical conflict is developed which in the son is
directed towards the father and in the daughter towards
the mother. This jealousy of the daughter towards the
mother is called the <em>Electra complex</em> from the myth of
Electra who took revenge on her mother for the murder
of the husband because she was in this way deprived of
her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>Normally as puberty is attained the child gradually
becomes more or less freed from his parents, and upon
the degree in which this is accomplished depends his
health and future well-being.</p>

<p class='c007'>This demand of nature upon the young individual to
free himself from the bonds of his childish dependency
and to find in the world of reality his independent existence
is so imperious and dominating that it frequently
produces in the child the greatest struggles and severest
conflicts, the period being characterized symbolically as a
<em>self-sacrifice</em> by Jung.</p>

<p class='c007'>It frequently happens that the young person is so
closely bound in the family relations that it is only with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>the greatest difficulty that he can attain any measure of
freedom and then only very imperfectly, so that the libido
sexualis can only express itself in certain feelings and
phantasies which clearly reveal the existence of the complex
until then entirely hidden and unrealized. Now
commences the secondary struggle against the unfilial and
immoral feelings with a consequent development of
intense resistances expressing themselves in irritation,
anger, revolt and antagonism against the parents, or else
in an especially tender, submissive and yielding attitude
which over-compensates for the rebellion and reaction
held within.</p>

<p class='c007'>This struggle and conflict gives rise to the unconscious
phantasy of self-sacrifice which really means the sacrificing
of the childish tendencies and love type in order to
free libido; for his nature demands that he attain the
capacity for the accomplishment of his own personal
fulfilment, the satisfaction of which belongs to the developed
man and woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>This conception has been worked out in detail by
Jung in the book which is herein presented to English
readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now come to the most important of Jung’s conceptions
in that it bears practically upon the treatment
of certain types of the neuroses and stands theoretically
in direct opposition to Freud’s hypothesis. While recognizing
fully the influence of the parents and of the sexual
constitution of the child, Jung refuses to see in this infantile
past the real cause for the later development of
the illness. He definitely places the cause of the pathogenic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>conflict <em>in the present moment</em> and considers that in
seeking for the cause in the distant past one is only following
the desire of the patient, which is to withdraw
himself as much as possible from the present important
period.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conflict is produced by some important task or
duty which is essential biologically and practically for the
fulfilment of the ego of the individual, but before which
an obstacle arises from which he shrinks, and thus halted
cannot go on. With this interference in the path of
progression libido is stored up and a <em>regression</em> takes
place whereby there occurs a reanimation of past ways
of libido occupation which were entirely normal to the
child, but which for the adult are no longer of value.
These regressive infantile desires and phantasies now
alive and striving for satisfaction are converted into
symptoms, and in these surrogate forms obtain a certain
gratification, thus creating the external manifestations of
the neurosis. Therefore Jung does not ask from what
psychic experience or point of fixation in childhood the
patient is suffering, but what is the present duty or task
he is avoiding, or what obstacle in his life’s path he is
unable to overcome? What is the cause of his regression
to past psychic experiences?</p>

<p class='c007'>Following this theory Jung expresses the view that the
elaborate phantasies and dreams produced by these patients
are really forms of compensation or artificial substitutes
for the unfulfilled adaptation to reality. The
sexual content of these phantasies and dreams is only
apparently and not actually expressive of a real sexual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvi'>xxxvi</span>desire or incest wish, but is a regressive employment of
sexual forms to symbolically express a present-day need
when the attainment of the present ego demand seems
too difficult or impossible, and no adaptation is made to
what is possible for the individual’s capability.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>With this statement Jung throws a new light on the
work of analytic psychology and on the conception of
the neurotic symptoms, and renders possible of understanding
the many apparent incongruities and conflicting
observations which have been so disturbing to the critics.</p>

<p class='c006'>It now becomes proper to ask what has been established
by all this mass of investigation into the soul, and
what is its value not only as a therapeutic measure for
the neurotic sufferer, but also for the normal human
being?</p>

<p class='c007'>First and perhaps most important is the recognition of
a definite psychological determinism. Instead of human
life being filled with foolish, meaningless or purposeless
actions, errors and thoughts, it can be demonstrated that
no expression or manifestation of the psyche, however
trifling or inconsistent in appearance, is really lawless or
unmotivated. Only a possession of the technique is necessary
in order to reveal, to any one desirous of knowing,
the existence of the unconscious determinants of his mannerisms,
trivial expressions, acts and behavior, their
purpose and significance.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvii'>xxxvii</span>This leads into the second fundamental conception,
which is perhaps even less considered than the foregoing,
and that is the relative value of the conscious mind and
thought. It is the general attitude of people to judge
themselves by their surface motives, to satisfy themselves
by saying or thinking “this is what I want to do or say”
or “I intended to do thus and so,” but somehow what
one thought, one intended to say or expected to do is very
often the contrary of what actually is said or done.
Every one has had these experiences when the gap between
the conscious thought and action was gross enough
to be observed. It is also a well known experience to
consciously desire something very much and when it is
obtained to discover that this in no wise satisfied or
lessened the desire, which was then transferred to some
other object. Thus one became cognizant of the fact
that the feeling and idea presented by consciousness as
the desire was an error. What is the difficulty in these
conditions? Evidently some other directing force than
that of which we are aware is at work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. G. Stanley Hall uses a very striking symbol when
he compares the mind to an iceberg floating in the ocean
with one-eighth visible above the water and seven-eighths
below—the one-eighth above being that part called conscious
and the seven-eighths below that which we call the
unconscious. The influence and controlling power of the
unconscious desires over our thoughts and acts are in this
relative proportion. Faint glimmers of other motives
and interests than those we accept or which we believe,
often flit into consciousness. These indications, if studied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxviii'>xxxviii</span>or valued accurately, would lead to the realization that
consciousness is but a single stage and but one form of
expression of mind. Therefore its dictum is but one,
often untrustworthy, approach to the great question as
to what is man’s actual psychic accomplishment, and as
to what in particular is the actual soul development of
the individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>A further contribution of equal importance has been
the empiric development of a dynamic theory of life; the
conception that life is in a state of flux—movement—leading
either to construction or destruction. Through the
development man has reached he has attained the power
by means of his intelligence and understanding of definitely
directing to a certain extent this life energy or
libido into avenues which serve his interest and bring a
real satisfaction for the present day.</p>

<p class='c007'>When man through ignorance and certain inherent
tendencies fails to recognize his needs or his power to
fulfil them, or to adapt himself to the conditions of reality
of the present time, there is then produced that reanimation
of infantile paths by which an attempt is made to
gain fulfilment or satisfaction through the production of
symptoms or attitudes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The acceptance of these statements demands the recognition
of the existence of an infantile sexuality and the
large part played by it in the later life of the individual.
Because of the power and imperious influence exerted by
the parents upon the child, and because of the unconscious
attachment of his libido to the original object, the mother,
and the perseverance of this first love model in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxix'>xxxix</span>psyche, he finds it very difficult, on reaching the stage
of adult development and the time for seeking a love
object outside of the family, to gain a satisfactory model.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is exceedingly important for parents and teachers
to recognize the requirements of nature, which, beginning
with puberty, imperiously demand of the young individual
a separation of himself from the parent stem and
the development of an independent existence. In our
complex modern civilization this demand of nature is
difficult enough of achievement for the child who has the
heartiest and most intelligent co-operation of his parents
and environment—but for the one who has not only to
contend with his own inner struggle for his freedom
but has in addition the resistance of his parents who
would hold him in his childhood at any cost, because they
cannot endure the thought of his separation from them,
the task becomes one of the greatest magnitude. It is
during this period when the struggle between the childish
inertia and nature’s urge becomes so keen, that there occur
the striking manifestations of jealousy, criticism, irritability
all usually directed against the parents, of defiance
of parental authority, of runaways and various other
psychic and nervous disorders known to all.</p>

<p class='c007'>This struggle, which is the first great task of mankind
and the one which requires the greatest effort, is that
which is expressed by Jung as the self-sacrifice motive—the
sacrifice of the childish feelings and demands, and of
the irresponsibility of this period, and the assumption of
the duties and tasks of an individual existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this great theme which Jung sees as the real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xl'>xl</span>motive lying hidden in the myths and religions of man
from the beginning, as well as in the literature and
artistic creations of both ancient and modern time,
and which he works out with the greatest wealth of
detail and painstaking effort in the book herewith presented.</p>

<p class='c007'>This necessitates a recognition and revaluation of the
enormous importance and influence of the ego and the
sexual instinct upon the thought and reaction of man,
and also predicates a displacement of the psychological
point of gravity from the will and intellect to the realm
of the emotions and feelings. The desired end is a
synthesis of these two paths or the use of the intellect
constructively in the service of the emotions in order to
gain for the best interest of the individual some sort of
co-operative reaction between the two.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one dealing with analytic psychology can fail to
be struck by the tremendous and unnecessary burdens
which man has placed upon himself, and how greatly
he has increased the difficulties of adaptation by his rigid
intellectual views and moral formulas, and by his inability
to admit to himself that he is actually just a human being
imperfect, and containing within himself all manner of
tendencies, good and bad, all striving for some satisfactory
goal. Further, that the refusal to see himself in
this light instead of as an ideal person in no way alters
the actual condition, and that in fact, through the cheap
pretense of being able only to consider himself as a very
virtuous person, or as shocked and hurt when observing
the “sins” of others, he actually is prevented from developing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xli'>xli</span>his own character and bringing his own capacities
to their fullest expressions.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is frequently expressed among people the idea
of how fortunate it is that we cannot see each other’s
thoughts, and how disturbing it would be if our real
feelings could be read. But what is so shameful in these
secrets of the soul? They are in reality our own egoistic
desires all striving, longing, wishing for satisfaction, for
happiness; those desires which instinctively crave their
own gratification but which can only be really fulfilled by
adapting them to the real world and to the social group.</p>

<p class='c007'>Why is it that it is so painful for man to admit that
the prime influence in all human endeavor is found in the
ego itself, in its desires, wishes, needs and satisfactions,
in short, in its need for self-expression and self-perpetuation,
the evolutionary impetus in life?</p>

<p class='c007'>The basis for the unpleasantness of this idea may perhaps
be found in an inner resistance in nature itself which
forces man to include others in his scheme, lest his own
greedy desires should serve to destroy him. But even
with this inner demand and all the ethical and moral
teachings of centuries it is everywhere evident that man
has only very imperfectly learned that it is to his own
interest to consider his neighbor and that it is impossible
for him to ignore the needs of the body social of which
he is a part. Externally, the recognition of the strength
of the ego impulse is objectionable because of the ideal
conception that self-striving and so-called selfish seeking
are unworthy, ignoble and incompatible with a desirable
character and must be ignored at all cost.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xlii'>xlii</span>The futility of this attitude is to be clearly seen in the
failure after all these centuries to even approximate it,
as evidenced in our human relations and institutions, and
is quite as ineffectual in this realm as in that of sexuality
where the effort to overcome this imperious domination
has been attempted by lowering the instinct, and seeing
in it something vile or unclean, something unspeakable
and unholy. Instead of destroying the power of sexuality
this struggle has only warped and distorted, injured and
mutilated the expression; for not without destruction of
the individual can these fundamental instincts be destroyed.
Life itself has needs and imperiously demands
expression through the forms created. All nature
answers to this freely and simply except man. His failure
to recognize himself as an instrument through which
the life energy is coursing and the demands of which
must be obeyed, is the cause of his misery. Despite his
possession of intellect and self-consciousness, he cannot
without disaster to himself refuse the tasks of life and
the fulfilment of his own needs. Man’s great task is
the adaptation of himself to reality and the recognition
of himself as an instrument for the expression of life
according to his individual possibilities.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in his privilege as a self-creator that his highest
purpose is found.</p>

<p class='c007'>The value of self-consciousness lies in the fact that
man is enabled to reflect upon himself and learn to understand
the true origin and significance of his actions and
opinions, that he may adequately value the real level of
his development and avoid being self-deceived and therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliii'>xliii</span>inhibited from finding his biological adaptation. He
need no longer be unconscious of the motives underlying
his actions or hide himself behind a changed exterior,
in other words, be merely a series of reactions to stimuli
as the mechanists have it, but he may to a certain extent
become a self-creating and self-determining being.</p>

<p class='c007'>Indeed, there seems to be an impulse towards adaptation
quite as Bergson sees it, and it would seem to be a
task of the highest order to use intelligence to assist one’s
self to work with this impulse.</p>

<p class='c006'>Through the investigation of these different avenues
leading into the hidden depths of the human being and
through the revelation of the motives and influences at
work there, although astonishing to the uninitiated, a
very clear and definite conception of the actual human
relationship—brotherhood—of all mankind is obtained.
It is this recognition of these common factors basically
inherent in humanity from the beginning and still active,
which is at once both the most hopeful and the most
feared and disliked part of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is disliked by those individuals who have prided
themselves upon their superiority and the distinction between
their reactions and motives and those of ordinary
mankind. In other words, they attempt to become personalities
through elevating themselves and lowering
others, and it is a distinct blow to discover that beneath
these pretensions lie the very ordinary elements shared
in common by all. On the other hand, to those who have
been able to recognize their own weaknesses and have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliv'>xliv</span>suffered in the privacy of their own souls, the knowledge
that these things have not set them apart from others,
but that they are the common property of all and that
no one can point the finger of scorn at his fellow, is one
of the greatest experiences of life and is productive
of the greatest relief.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is feared by many who realize that in these painfully
acquired repressions and symptoms lie their safety and
their protection from directly facing and dealing with
tendencies and characteristics with which they feel unable
to cope. The repression and the accompanying symptoms
indicate a difficulty and a struggle, and in this way are
a sort of compromise or substitute formation which
permit, although only in a wasteful and futile manner,
the activity of the repressed tendencies. Nevertheless,
to analyze the individual back to his original tendencies
and reveal to him the meaning of these substitute formations
would be a useless procedure in which truly “the
last state of that man would be worse than the first”
if the work ceased there. The aim is not to destroy
those barriers upon which civilized man has so painfully
climbed and to reduce him to his primitive state, but,
where these have failed or imperfectly succeeded, to help
him to attain his greatest possibilities with less expenditure
of energy, by less wasteful methods than nature
provides. In this achievement lies the hopeful and valuable
side of this method—the development of the synthesis.
It is hopeful because now a way is opened to
deal with these primitive tendencies constructively, and
render their effects not only harmless but useful, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlv'>xlv</span>utilizing them in higher aims, socially and individually
valuable and satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is what has occurred normally in those individuals
who seem capable and constructive personalities; in those
creative minds that give so much to the race. They have
converted certain psychological tendencies which could
have produced useless symptoms or destructive actions
into valuable productions. Indeed it is not uncommon
for strong, capable persons to state themselves that they
knew they could have been equally capable of a wasteful
or destructive life. This utilization of the energy or
libido freed by removing the repressions and the lifting
of infantile tendencies and desires into higher purposes
and directions suitable for the individual at his present
status is called <em>sublimation</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must not be understood by this discussion that
geniuses or wonderful personalities can be created
through analysis, for this is not the aim of the procedure.
Its purpose is to remove the inhibitions and restrictions
which interfere with the full development of the personality,
to help individuals attain to that level where
they really belong, and to prepare people to better understand
and meet life whether they are neurotic sufferers
or so-called “normal people” with the difficulties and
peculiarities which belong to all.</p>

<p class='c007'>This reasoning and method of procedure is only new
when the application is made to the human being. In
all improvements of plants and animals these general
principles have been recognized and their teachings constructively
utilized.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvi'>xlvi</span>Luther Burbank, that plant wizard whose work is
known to all the world, says, “A knowledge of the battle
of the tendencies within a plant is the very basis of all
plant improvement,” and “it is not that the work of plant
improvement brings with it, incidentally, as people mistakenly
think, a knowledge of these forces, it is the knowledge
of these forces, rather, which makes plant improvement
possible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Has this not been also the mistake of man regarding
himself, and the cause, partly at least, of his failure to
succeed in actually reaching a more advanced and stable
development?</p>

<p class='c007'>This recognition of man’s biological relationship to
all life and the practical utilization of this recognition,
necessitates a readjustment of thought and asks for an
examination and reconsideration of the facts of human
conduct which are observable by any thoughtful person.
A quiet and progressive upheaval of old ideas has taken
place and is still going on. Analytic psychology attempts
to unify and value all of the various phenomena of man
which have been observed and noted at different times
by isolated investigators of isolated manifestations and
thus bring some orderly sequence into the whole. It
offers a method whereby the relations of the human being
biologically to all other living forms can be established,
the actual achievement of man himself adequately valued,
and opens a vista of the possibilities of improvement in
health, happiness and accomplishment for the human
being.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>AUTHOR’S NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>My task in this work has been to investigate an individual
phantasy system, and in the doing of it problems
of such magnitude have been uncovered, that my endeavor
to grasp them in their entirety has necessarily
meant only a superficial orientation toward those paths,
the opening and exploration of which may possibly
crown the work of future investigators with success.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am not in sympathy with the attitude which favors
the repression of certain possible working hypotheses
because they are perhaps erroneous, and so may possess
no lasting value. Certainly I endeavored as far as possible
to guard myself from error, which might indeed
become especially dangerous upon these dizzy heights,
for I am entirely aware of the risks of these investigations.
However, I do not consider scientific work as a
dogmatic contest, but rather as a work done for the increase
and deepening of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>This contribution is addressed to those having similar
ideas concerning science.</p>

<p class='c007'>In conclusion, I must render thanks to those who have
assisted my endeavors with valuable aid, especially my
dear wife and my friends, to whose disinterested assistance
I am deeply indebted.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class='c006'>Any one who can read Freud’s “Interpretation of the
Dream” without scientific rebellion at the newness and
apparently unjustified daring of its analytical presentation,
and without moral indignation at the astonishing
nudity of the dream interpretation, and who can allow
this unusual array of facts to influence his mind calmly
and without prejudice, will surely be deeply impressed at
that place where Freud calls to mind the fact that
an individual psychologic conflict, namely, the Incest
Phantasy, is the essential root of that powerful ancient
dramatic material, the Oedipus legend. The impression
made by this simple reference may be likened to that
wholly peculiar feeling which arises in us if, for example,
in the noise and tumult of a modern street we should
come across an ancient relic—the Corinthian capital of a
walled-in column, or a fragment of inscription. Just a
moment ago we were given over to the noisy ephemeral
life of the present, when something very far away and
strange appears to us, which turns our attention to things
of another order; a glimpse away from the incoherent
multiplicity of the present to a higher coherence in history.
Very likely it would suddenly occur to us that on
this spot where we now run busily to and fro a similar
life and activity prevailed two thousand years ago in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>somewhat other forms; similar passions moved mankind,
and man was likewise convinced of the uniqueness of his
existence. I would liken the impression which the first
acquaintance with the monuments of antiquity so easily
leaves behind to that impression which Freud’s reference
to the Oedipus legend makes—for while we are still engaged
with the confusing impressions of the variability of
the Individual Soul, suddenly there is opened a revelation
of the simple greatness of the Oedipus tragedy—that
never extinguished light of the Grecian theatre.</p>

<p class='c007'>This breadth of outlook carries in itself something of
revelation. For us, the ancient psychology has long since
been buried among the shadows of the past; in the schoolroom
one could scarcely repress a sceptical smile when
one indiscreetly reckoned the comfortable matronly age
of Penelope and the age of Jocasta, and comically compared
the result of the reckoning with the tragic-erotic
struggles in the legend and drama. We did not know at
that time (and who knows even to-day?) that the mother
can be the all-consuming passion of the son, which perhaps
undermines his whole life and tragically destroys
it, so that not even the magnitude of the Oedipus Fate
seems one jot overdrawn. Rare and pathologically understood
cases like Ninon de Lenclos and her son<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> lie too
far removed from most of us to give a living impression.
But when we follow the paths traced out by Freud, we
arrive at a recognition of the present existence of such
possibilities, which, although they are too weak to enforce
incest, are still strong enough to cause disturbances
of considerable magnitude in the soul. The admission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of such possibilities to one’s self does not occur without a
great burst of moral revulsion. Resistances arise which
only too easily dazzle the intellect, and, through that,
make knowledge of self impossible. Whenever we succeed,
however, in stripping feelings from more scientific
knowledge, then that abyss which separates our age from
the antique is bridged, and, with astonishment, we see
that Oedipus is still a living thing for us. The importance
of such an impression should not be undervalued. We
are taught by this insight that there is an identity of
elementary human conflicts existing independent of time
and place. That which affected the Greeks with horror
still remains true, but it is true for us only when we give
up a vain illusion that we are different—that is to say,
more moral, than the ancients. We of the present day
have nearly succeeded in forgetting that an indissoluble
common bond binds us to the people of antiquity. With
this truth a path is opened to the understanding of the
ancient mind; an understanding which so far has not
existed, and, on one side, leads to an inner sympathy, and,
on the other side, to an intellectual comprehension.
Through buried strata of the individual soul we come
indirectly into possession of the living mind of the ancient
culture, and, just precisely through that, do we win that
stable point of view outside our own culture, from which,
for the first time, an objective understanding of their
mechanisms would be possible. At least that is the hope
which we get from the rediscovery of the Oedipus
problem.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enquiry made possible by Freud’s work has already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>resulted fruitfully; we are indebted to this stimulation
for some bold attacks upon the territory of the
history of the human mind. There are the works of
Riklin,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Abraham,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Rank,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Maeder,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Jones,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a>—recently
Silberer has joined their ranks with a beautiful investigation
entitled “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Phantasie und Mythus.</span>”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a> We are indebted
to Pfister<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a> for a comprehensive work which
cannot be overlooked here, and which is of much importance
for Christian religious psychology. The leading
purpose of these works is the unlocking of historical
problems through the application of psychoanalytic
knowledge; that is to say, knowledge drawn from the
activity of the modern unconscious mind concerning specific
historical material.</p>

<p class='c007'>I must refer the reader entirely to the specified works,
in order that he may gain information concerning the
extent and the kind of insight which has already been
obtained. The explanations are in many cases dubious
in particulars; nevertheless, this detracts in no way from
the total result. It would be significant enough if only
the far-reaching analogy between the psychologic structure
of the historical relics and the structure of the recent
individual psychologic products alone were demonstrated.
This proof is possible of attainment for every intelligent
person through the work done up to this time. The
analogy prevails especially in symbolism, as Riklin, Rank,
Maeder, and Abraham have pointed out with illuminating
examples; it is also shown in the individual mechanisms
of unconscious work, that is to say in repression,
condensation, etc., as Abraham explicitly shows.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Up to the present time the psychoanalytic investigator
has turned his interest chiefly to the analysis of the individual
psychologic problems. It seems to me, however,
that in the present state of affairs there is a more or less
imperative demand for the psychoanalyst to broaden
the analysis of the individual problems by a comparative
study of historical material relating to them, just as
Freud has already done in a masterly manner in his book
on “Leonardo da Vinci.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a> For, just as the psychoanalytic
conceptions promote understanding of the historic
psychologic creations, so reversedly historical materials
can shed new light upon individual psychologic
problems. These and similar considerations have caused
me to turn my attention somewhat more to the historical,
in the hope that, out of this, new insight into the foundations
of individual psychology might be won.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>CONCERNING THE TWO KINDS OF THINKING</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is a well-known fact that one of the principles of
analytic psychology is that the dream images are to be
understood symbolically; that is to say, that they are not
to be taken literally just as they are presented in sleep,
but that behind them a hidden meaning has to be surmised.
It is this ancient idea of a dream symbolism which
has challenged not only criticism, but, in addition to that,
the strongest opposition. That dreams may be full of
import, and, therefore, something to be interpreted, is certainly
neither a strange nor an extraordinary idea. This
has been familiar to mankind for thousands of years, and,
therefore, seems much like a banal truth. The dream
interpretations of the Egyptians and Chaldeans, and the
story of Joseph who interpreted Pharaoh’s dreams, are
known to every one, and the dream book of Artemidorus
is also familiar. From countless inscribed monuments of
all times and peoples we learn of foreboding dreams, of
significant, of prophetic and also of curative dreams
which the Deity sent to the sick, sleeping in the temple.
We know the dream of the mother of Augustus, who
dreamt she was to be with child by the Deity transformed
into a snake. We will not heap up references
and examples to bear witness to the existence of a belief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>in the symbolism of dreams. When an idea is so old,
and is so generally believed, it is probably true in some
way, and, indeed, as is mostly the case, <em>is not literally
true, but is true psychologically</em>. In this distinction lies
the reason why the old fogies of science have from time
to time thrown away an inherited piece of ancient truth;
because it was not literal but psychologic truth. For such
discrimination this type of person has at no time had any
comprehension.</p>

<p class='c007'>From our experience, it is hardly conceivable that a
God existing outside of ourselves causes dreams, or that
the dream, eo ipso, foresees the future prophetically.
When we translate this into the psychologic, however,
then the ancient theories sound much more reconcilable,
namely, <em>the dream arises from a part of the mind unknown
to us, but none the less important, and is concerned
with the desires for the approaching day</em>. This psychologic
formula derived from the ancient superstitious conception
of dreams, is, so to speak, exactly identified
with the Freudian psychology, which assumes a rising
wish from the unconscious to be the source of the
dream.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the old belief teaches, the Deity or the Demon
speaks in symbolic speech to the sleeper, and the dream
interpreter has the riddle to solve. In modern speech we
say this means that the dream is a <em>series of images, which
are apparently contradictory and nonsensical, but arise in
reality from psychologic material which yields a clear
meaning</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were I to suppose among my readers a far-reaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>ignorance of dream analysis, then I should be obliged to
illustrate this statement with numerous examples.
To-day, however, these things are quite well known, so
that one must proceed carefully with every-day dream
material, out of consideration for a public educated in
these matters. It is a special inconvenience that no dream
can be recounted without being obliged to add to it half
a life’s history which affords the individual foundations
of the dream, but there are some few typical dreams
which can be told without too great a ballast. One of
these is the dream of the sexual assault, which is especially
prevalent among women. A girl sleeping after an evening
happily spent in dancing, dreams that a robber breaks
open her door noisily and stabs through her body
with a lance. This theme, which explains itself, has
countless variations, some simple, some complicated.
Instead of the lance it is a sword, a dagger, a revolver,
a gun, a cannon, a hydrant, a watering pot; or the assault
is a burglary, a pursuit, a robbery, or it is some one
hidden in the closet or under the bed. Or the danger
may be illustrated by wild animals; for instance, a horse
which throws the dreamer to the ground and kicks her in
the body with his hind foot; lions, tigers, elephants with
threatening trunks, and finally snakes in endless variety.
Sometimes the snake creeps into the mouth, sometimes
it bites the breast like Cleopatra’s legendary asp, sometimes
it comes in the rôle of the paradisical snake, or in
the variations of Franz Stuck, whose pictures of snakes
bear the significant titles “Vice,” “Sin,” “Lust.” The
mixture of lust and anxiety is expressed incomparably in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the very atmosphere of these pictures, and far more
brutally, indeed, than in Mörike’s charming poem.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these things are simple, and need no explanation
to be intelligible. Somewhat more complicated, but still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>unmistakable, is the dream of a woman; she sees the
triumphal arch of Constantine. A cannon stands before
it, to the right of it a bird, to the left a man. A shot
flashes out of the tube; the projectile hits her; it goes
into her pocket, into her purse. There it remains, and
she holds her purse as if something very precious were
in it. The image disappears, and she continues to see
only the stock of the cannon, and over that Constantine’s
motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In hoc signo vinces.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>These few references to the symbolic nature of dreams
are perhaps sufficient. For whomsoever the proof may
appear insufficient, and it is certainly insufficient for a
beginner, further evidence may be found in the fundamental
work of Freud, and in the works of Stekel and
Rank which are fuller in certain particulars. We must
assume here that the dream symbolism is an established
fact, in order to bring to our study a mind suitably prepared
for an appreciation of this work. We would not
be successful if we, on the contrary, were to be astonished
at the idea that an intellectual image can be projected
into our conscious psychic activity; an image which apparently
obeys such wholly other laws and purposes than
those governing the conscious psychic product.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Why are dreams symbolic?</em> Every “why” in psychology
is divided into two separate questions: first, <em>for what
purpose are dreams symbolic</em>? We will answer this
question only to abandon it at once. Dreams are symbolic
in order that they can not be understood; in order that
the wish, which is the source of the dream, may remain
unknown. The question why this is so and not otherwise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>leads us out into the far-reaching experiences and trains
of thought of the Freudian psychology.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the second question interests us, viz., <em>How is it
that dreams are symbolic?</em> That is to say, from where
does this capacity for symbolic representation come, of
which we, in our conscious daily life, can discover apparently
no traces?</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us examine this more closely. Can we really discover
nothing symbolic in our every-day thought? Let
us follow our trains of thought; let us take an example.
We think of the war of 1870 and 1871. We think about
a series of bloody battles, the siege of Strassburg, Belfort,
Paris, the Treaty of Peace, the foundation of the
German Empire, and so on. How have we been thinking?
We start with an idea, or super-idea, as it is also
called, and without thinking of it, but each time merely
guided by a feeling of direction, we think about individual
reminiscences of the war. In this we can find nothing
symbolic, and our whole conscious thinking proceeds according
to this type.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>If we observe our thinking very narrowly, and follow
an intensive train of thought, as, for example, the solution
of a difficult problem, then suddenly we notice that
we are thinking in words, that in wholly intensive thinking
we begin to speak to ourselves, or that we occasionally
write down the problem, or make a drawing of it so as to
be absolutely clear. It must certainly have happened
to any one who has lived for some time in a foreign
country, that after a certain period he has begun to think
in the language of the country. A very intensive train
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of thinking works itself out more or less in <em>word form</em>;
that is, if one wants to express it, to teach it, or to convince
any one of it. Evidently it directs itself wholly to
the outside world. To this extent, this directed or logical
thinking is a reality thinking,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a> having a real existence for
us; that is to say, a thinking which adjusts itself to actual
conditions,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a> where we, expressed in other words, imitate
the succession of objectively real things, so that the
images in our mind follow after each other in the same
strictly causal succession as the historical events outside
of our mind.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c008'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>We call this thinking, thinking with directed attention.
It has, in addition, the peculiarity that one is tired by it,
and that, on this account, it is set into action only for a
time. Our whole vital accomplishment, which is so expensive,
is adaptation to environment; a part of it is the
directed thinking, which, biologically expressed, is nothing
but a process of psychic assimilation, which, as in
every vital accomplishment, leaves behind a corresponding
exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The material with which we think is <em>language and
speech concept</em>, a thing which has been used from time
immemorial as something external, a bridge for thought,
and which has a single purpose—that of communication.
As long as we think directedly, we think for others and
speak to others.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Speech is originally a system of emotional and imitative
sounds—sounds which express terror, fear, anger,
love; and sounds which imitate the noises of the elements,
the rushing and gurgling of water, the rolling of thunder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the tumults of the winds, the tones of the animal world,
and so on; and, finally, those which represent a combination
of the sounds of perception and of affective reaction.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c008'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
Likewise in the more or less modern languages, large
quantities of onomatopoetic relics are retained; for example,
sounds for the movement of water,—</p>

<p class='c017'>Rauschen, risseln, rûschen, rinnen, rennen, to rush, ruscello,
ruisseau, river, Rhein.</p>

<p class='c017'>Wasser, wissen, wissern, pissen, piscis, fisch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus language is originally and essentially nothing but
a system of signs or symbols, which denote real occurrences,
or their echo in the human soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore one must decidedly agree with Anatole
France,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c008'><sup>[19]</sup></a> when he says,</p>

<p class='c017'>“What is thought, and how do we think? We think with
words; that alone is sensual and brings us back to nature. Think
of it! The metaphysician has only the perfected cry of monkeys
and dogs with which to construct the system of the world. That
which he calls profound speculation and transcendent method is
to put end to end in an arbitrary order the natural sounds which
cry out hunger, fear, and love in the primitive forests, and to
which were attached little by little the meanings which one believed
to be abstract, when they were only crude.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do not fear that the succession of small cries, feeble and
stifled, which compose a book of philosophy, will teach us so
much regarding the universe, that we can live in it no longer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus is our directed thinking, and even if we were the
loneliest and furthest removed from our fellows, this
thinking is nothing but the first notes of a long-drawn-out
call to our companions that water had been found,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>that we had killed the bear, that a storm was approaching,
or that wolves were prowling around the camp. A
striking paradox of Abélard’s which expresses in a very
intuitive way the whole human limitation of our complicated
thinking process, reads,—“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sermo generatur ab
intellectu et generat intellectum</span></i>.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c008'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Any system of philosophy, no matter how abstract,
represents in means and purpose nothing more than an
extremely cleverly developed combination of original
nature sounds.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c008'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Hence arises the desire of a Schopenhauer
or a Nietzsche for recognition and understanding,
and the despair and bitterness of their loneliness. One
might expect, perhaps, that a man full of genius could
pasture in the greatness of his own thoughts, and renounce
the cheap approbation of the crowd which he
despises; yet he succumbs to the more powerful impulse
of the herd instinct. His searching and his finding, his
call, belong to the herd.</p>

<p class='c007'>When I said just now that directed thinking is properly
a thinking with words, and quoted that clever testimony
of Anatole France as drastic proof of it, a misunderstanding
might easily arise, namely, that directed thinking
is really only “word.” That certainly would go too far.
Language should, however, be comprehended in a wider
sense than that of speech, which is in itself only the expression
of the formulated thought which is capable of
being communicated in the widest sense. Otherwise, the
deaf mute would be limited to the utmost in his capacity
for thinking, which is not the case in reality. Without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>any knowledge of the spoken word, he has his
“language.” This language, considered from the standpoint
of history, or in other words, directed thinking,
is here a descendant of the primitive words, as, for instance,
Wundt<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c008'><sup>[22]</sup></a> expresses it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“A further important result of that co-operation of sound and
sign interchange consists in the fact that very many words gradually
lose altogether their original concrete thought meaning, and
turn into signs for general ideas and for the expression of the
apperceptive functions of relation and comparison and their
products. In this manner abstract thought develops, which, because
it would not be possible without the change of meaning lying at
the root of it, is indeed a production of that psychic and psychophysical
reciprocal action out of which the development of language
takes place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jodl<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c008'><sup>[23]</sup></a> denies the identity of language and thought,
because, for one reason, one and the same psychic fact
might be expressed in different languages in different
ways. From that he draws the conclusion that a “super-language
thinking” exists. Certainly there is such a thing,
whether with Erdmann one considers it “hypologisch,”
or with Jodl as “super-language.” Only this is not
logical thinking. My conception of it agrees with the
noteworthy contribution made by Baldwin, which I will
quote here word for word.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c008'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“The transmission from pre-judgmental to judgmental meaning
is just that from knowledge which has social confirmation
to that which gets along without it. The meanings utilized for
judgment are those already developed in their presuppositions
and applications through the confirmation of social intercourse.
Thus, the personal judgment, trained in the methods of social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>rendering, and disciplined by the interaction of its social world,
projects its content into that world again. In other words, the
platform for all movement into the assertion of individual judgment—the
level from which new experience is utilized—is already
and always socialized; and it is just this movement that we find
reflected in the actual results as the sense of the ‘appropriateness’
or synomic character of the meaning rendered.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Now the development of thought, as we are to see in more
detail, is by a method essentially of trial and error, of experimentation,
of the use of meanings as worth more than they are as
yet recognized to be worth. The individual must use his own
thoughts, his established knowledges, his grounded judgments, for
the embodiment of his new inventive constructions. He erects
his thought as we say ‘schematically’—in logic terms, ‘problematically,’
conditionally, disjunctively; projecting into the
world an opinion still peculiar to himself, as if it were true. <em>Thus
all discovery proceeds.</em> But this is, from the linguistic point of
view, still to use the current language, still to work by meanings
already embodied in social and conventional usage.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Language grows, therefore, just as thought does, by never
losing its synomic or dual reference; its meaning is both personal
and social.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is the register of tradition, the record of racial conquest,
the deposit of all the gains made by the genius of individuals....
The social copy-system, thus established, reflects the
judgmental processes of the race, and in turn becomes the
training school of the judgment of new generations.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Most of the training of the self, whereby the vagaries of
personal reaction to fact and image are reduced to the basis of
sound judgment, comes through the use of speech. When the
child speaks, he lays before the world his suggestion for a general
or common meaning. The reception he gets confirms or refutes
him. In either case he is instructed. His next venture is now
from a platform of knowledge on which the newer item is more
nearly convertible into the common coin of effective intercourse.
The point to notice here is not so much the exact mechanism of
the exchange—secondary conversion—by which this gain is made,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>as the training in judgment that the constant use of it affords.
In each case, effective judgment is the common judgment.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Here the object is to point out that it is secured by the
development of a function <em>whose rise is directly ad hoc</em>, directly
for the social experimentation by which growth in personal competence
is advanced as well—<em>the function of speech</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In language, therefore, to sum up the foregoing, we have the
tangible—the actual—the historical—instrument of the development
and conservation of psychic meaning. It is the material
evidence and proof of the <em>concurrence of social and personal judgment</em>.
In it synomic meaning, judged as ‘appropriate,’ becomes
‘social’ meaning, held as socially generalized and acknowledged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These arguments of Baldwin abundantly emphasize
the wide-reaching limitations of thinking caused by
language.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c008'><sup>[25]</sup></a> These limitations are of the greatest significance,
both subjectively and objectively; at least their
meaning is great enough to force one to ask one’s self if,
after all, in regard to independence of thought, Franz
Mauthner, thoroughly sceptical, is not really correct in
his view that thinking is speech and nothing more.
Baldwin expresses himself more cautiously and reservedly;
nevertheless, his inner meaning is plainly in favor
of the primacy of speech (naturally not in the sense of
the spoken word); the directed thinking, or as we might
perhaps call it, the thinking in internal speech, is the
manifest instrument of culture, and we do not go astray
when we say that the powerful work of education which
the centuries have given to directed thinking has produced,
just through the peculiar development of thinking
from the individual subjective into the social objective, a
practical application of the human mind to which we owe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>modern empiricism and technic, and which occurs for absolutely
the first time in the history of the world. Inquisitive
minds have often tormented themselves with the
question why the undoubtedly extraordinary knowledge
of mathematics and principles and material facts
united with the unexampled art of the human hand in
antiquity never arrived at the point of developing those
known technical statements of fact, for instance, the
principles of simple machines, beyond the realm of the
amusing and curious to a real technic in the modern sense.
There is necessarily only one answer to this; the ancients
almost entirely, with the exception of a few extraordinary
minds, lacked the capacity to allow their interest to
follow the transformations of inanimate matter to the
extent necessary for them to be able to reproduce the
process of nature, creatively and through their own art,
by means of which alone they could have succeeded in
putting themselves in possession of the force of nature.
That which they lacked was training in directed thinking,
or, to express it psychoanalytically, the ancients did not
succeed in tearing loose the libido which might be sublimated,
from the other natural relations, and did not
turn voluntarily to anthropomorphism. The secret of
the development of culture lies in the <em>mobility of the
libido</em>, and in its capacity for transference. It is, therefore,
to be assumed that the directed thinking of our time
is a more or less modern acquisition, which was lacking
in earlier times.</p>

<p class='c007'>But with that we come to a further question, viz., what
happens if we do not think directedly? Then our thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>lacks the major idea, and the feeling of direction which
emanates from that.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c008'><sup>[26]</sup></a> We no longer compel our
thoughts along a definite track, but let them float, sink
and mount according to their own gravity. According
to Kulpe<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c008'><sup>[27]</sup></a> thinking is a kind of inner will action, the
absence of which necessarily leads to an automatic play
of ideas. James understands the non-directed thinking,
or “merely associative” thinking, as the ordinary one.
He expresses himself about that in the following
manner:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our thought consists for the great part of a series of images,
one of which produces the other; <em>a sort of passive dream-state of
which the higher animals are also capable</em>. This sort of thinking
leads, nevertheless, to reasonable conclusions of a practical as well
as of a theoretical nature.</p>

<p class='c017'>“As a rule, the links of this sort of irresponsible thinking,
which are accidentally bound together, are empirically concrete
things, not abstractions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We can, in the following manner, complete these definitions
of William James. This sort of thinking does
not tire us; it quickly leads us away from reality into
phantasies of the past and future. Here, thinking in the
form of speech ceases, image crowds upon image, feeling
upon feeling; more and more clearly one sees a
tendency which creates and makes believe, not as it truly
is, but as one indeed might wish it to be.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c008'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The material
of these thoughts which turns away from reality, can
naturally be only the past with its thousand memory pictures.
The customary speech calls this kind of thinking
“dreaming.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Whoever attentively observes himself will find the
general custom of speech very striking, for almost every
day we can see for ourselves how, when falling asleep,
phantasies are woven into our dreams, so that between
the dreams of day and night there is not so great a
difference. Thus we have two forms of thinking—<em>directed
thinking</em> and <em>dream or phantasy thinking</em>. The
first, working for communication with speech elements,
is troublesome and exhausting; the latter, on the contrary,
goes on without trouble, working spontaneously, so to
speak, with reminiscences. The first creates innovations,
adaptations, imitates reality and seeks to act upon it.
The latter, on the contrary, turns away from reality, sets
free subjective wishes, and is, in regard to adaptation,
wholly unproductive.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c008'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Let us leave aside the query as to why we possess these
two different ways of thinking, and turn back to the
second proposition, namely, how comes it that we have
two different ways of thinking? I have intimated above
that history shows us that directed thinking was not
always as developed as it is at present. In this age the
most beautiful expression of directed thinking is science,
and the technic fostered by it. Both things are indebted
for their existence simply to an energetic education in
directed thinking. At the time, however, when a few
forerunners of the present culture, like the poet Petrarch,
first began to appreciate Nature understandingly<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c008'><sup>[30]</sup></a> there
was already in existence an equivalent for our science, to
wit, scholasticism.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c008'><sup>[31]</sup></a> This took its objects from the phantasies
of the past, and it gave to the mind a dialectic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>training in directed thinking. The only success which
beckoned the thinker was rhetorical victory in disputation,
and not a visible transformation of reality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subjects of thinking were often astonishingly
phantastical; for example, questions were discussed, such
as how many angels could have a place on the point of
a needle? Whether Christ could have done his work
of redemption equally well if he had come into the
world as a pea? The possibility of such problems, to
which belong the metaphysical problems in general, viz.,
to be able to know the unknowable, shows us of what
peculiar kind that mind must have been which created
such things which to us are the height of absurdity.
Nietzsche had guessed, however, at the biological background
of this phenomenon when he spoke of the “beautiful
tension” of the Germanic mind which the Middle
Ages created. Taken historically, scholasticism, in the
spirit of which persons of towering intellectual powers,
such as Thomas of Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Abélard, William
of Occam and others, have labored, is the mother of
the modern scientific attitude, and a later time will see
clearly how and in what scholasticism still furnishes
living undercurrents to the science of to-day. Its whole
nature lies in dialectic gymnastics which have raised the
symbol of speech, the word, to an almost absolute meaning,
so that it finally attained to that substantiality which
expiring antiquity could lend to its <em>logos</em> only temporarily,
through attributes of mystical valuation. The great
work of scholasticism, however, appears to be the foundation
of firmly knitted intellectual sublimation, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">conditio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>sine qua non</span></i> of the modern scientific and technical
spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should we go further back into history, we shall find
that which to-day we call science, dissolved into an indistinct
cloud. The modern culture-creating mind is incessantly
occupied in stripping off all subjectivity from experience,
and in finding those formulas which bring
Nature and her forces to the best and most fitting expression.
It would be an absurd and entirely unjustified self-glorification
if we were to assume that we are more
energetic or more intelligent than the ancients—our
materials for knowledge have increased, but not our intellectual
capacity. For this reason, we become immediately
as obstinate and insusceptible in regard to new
ideas as people in the darkest times of antiquity. Our
knowledge has increased but not our wisdom. The main
point of our interest is displaced wholly into material
reality; antiquity preferred a mode of thought which was
more closely related to a phantastic type. Except for a
sensitive perspicuity towards works of art, not attained
since then, we seek in vain in antiquity for that precise
and concrete manner of thinking characteristic of modern
science. We see the antique spirit create not science but
mythology. Unfortunately, we acquire in school only
a very paltry conception of the richness and immense
power of life of Grecian mythology.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore, at first glance, it does not seem possible for
us to assume that that energy and interest which to-day
we put into science and technic, the man of antiquity gave
in great part to his mythology. That, nevertheless, gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the explanation for the bewildering changes, the kaleidoscopic
transformations and new syncretistic groupings,
and the continued rejuvenation of the myths in the
Grecian sphere of culture. Here, we move in a world
of phantasies, which, little concerned with the outer
course of things, flows from an inner source, and, constantly
changing, creates now plastic, now shadowy
shapes. This phantastical activity of the ancient mind
created artistically <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</span></i>. The object of the interest
does not seem to have been to grasp hold of the
“how” of the real world as objectively and exactly as
possibly, but to æsthetically adapt subjective phantasies
and expectations. There was very little place among
ancient people for the coldness and disillusion which
Giordano Bruno’s thoughts on eternity and Kepler’s discoveries
brought to modern humanity. The naïve man
of antiquity saw in the sun the great Father of the heaven
and the earth, and in the moon the fruitful good Mother.
Everything had its demons; they animated equally a
human being and his brother, the animal. Everything
was considered according to its anthropomorphic or
theriomorphic attributes, as human being or animal.
Even the disc of the sun was given wings or four feet,
in order to illustrate its movement. Thus arose an idea
of the universe which was not only very far from reality,
but was one which corresponded wholly to subjective
phantasies.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know, from our own experience, this state of mind.
It is an infantile stage. To a child the moon is a man or
a face or a shepherd of the stars. The clouds in the sky
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>seem like little sheep; the dolls drink, eat and sleep; the
child places a letter at the window for the Christ-child;
he calls to the stork to bring him a little brother or
sister; the cow is the wife of the horse, and the dog the
husband of the cat. We know, too, that lower races, like
the negroes, look upon the locomotive as an animal, and
call the drawers of the table the child of the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we learn through Freud, the dream shows a similar
type. Since the dream is unconcerned with the real condition
of things, it brings the most heterogeneous matter
together, and a world of impossibilities takes the place
of realities. Freud finds progression characteristic of
thinking when awake; that is to say, the advancement of
the thought excitation from the system of the inner or
outer perception through the “endopsychic” work of
association, conscious and unconscious, to the motor end;
that is to say, towards innervation. In the dream he finds
the reverse, namely, regression of the thought excitation
from the preconscious or unconscious to the system of
perception, by the means of which the dream receives
its ordinary impression of sensuous distinctness, which
can rise to an almost hallucinating clearness. The dream
thinking moves in a retrograde manner towards the raw
material of memory. “The structure of the dream
thoughts is dissolved during the progress of regression
into its raw material.” The reanimation of the original
perception is, however, only one side of regression. The
other side is regression to the infantile memory material,
which might also be understood as regression to the
original perception, but which deserves especial mention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>on account of its independent importance. This regression
might, indeed, be considered as “historical.” The
dream, according to this conception, might also be described
as <em>the substitute of the infantile scene, changed
through transference into the recent scene</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The infantile scene cannot carry through its revival;
it must be satisfied with its return as a dream. From
this conception of the historical side of regression, it follows
consequently that the modes of conclusion of the
dream, in so far as one may speak of them, must show
at the same time an analogous and infantile character.
This is truly the case, as experience has abundantly
shown, so that to-day every one who is familiar with the
subject of dream analysis confirms Freud’s proposition
that <em>dreams are a piece of the conquered life of the
childish soul</em>. Inasmuch as the childish psychic life is
undeniably of an archaic type, this characteristic belongs
to the dream in quite an unusual degree. Freud calls our
attention to this especially.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The dream, which fulfils its wishes by a short, regressive
path, affords us only an example of the primary method of working
of the psychic apparatus, which has been abandoned by us as
unsuitable. That which once ruled in the waking state, when the
psychical life was still young and impotent, appears to be banished
to the dream life, in somewhat the same way as the bow and
arrow, those discarded, primitive weapons of adult humanity, have
been relegated to the nursery.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c008'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>All this experience suggests to us that we draw a
parallel between the phantastical, mythological thinking
of antiquity and the similar thinking of children, between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the lower human races and dreams.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c008'><sup>[33]</sup></a> This train of
thought is not a strange one for us, but quite familiar
through our knowledge of comparative anatomy and the
history of development, which show us how the structure
and function of the human body are the results of a series
of embryonic changes which correspond to similar
changes in the history of the race. Therefore, the supposition
is justified that ontogenesis corresponds in
psychology to phylogenesis. Consequently, it would
be true, as well, that the state of infantile thinking in the
child’s psychic life, as well as in dreams, is nothing but a
re-echo of the prehistoric and the ancient.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c008'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to this, Nietzsche takes a very broad and remarkable
standpoint.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c008'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“In our sleep and in our dreams we pass through the whole
thought of earlier humanity. I mean, in the same way that man
reasons in his dreams, he reasoned when in the waking state many
thousands of years. The first <em>causa</em> which occurred to his mind in
reference to anything that needed explanation, satisfied him and
passed for truth. In the dream this atavistic relic of humanity
manifests its existence within us, for it is the foundation upon
which the higher rational faculty developed, and which is still
developing in every individual. The dream carries us back into
earlier states of human culture, and affords us a means of understanding
it better. The dream thought is so easy to us now,
because we are so thoroughly trained to it through the interminable
stages of evolution during which this phantastic and facile form
of theorizing has prevailed. To a certain extent the dream is
a restorative for the brain, which during the day is called upon
to meet the severe demands for trained thought, made by the
conditions of a higher civilization.</p>

<p class='c017'>“From these facts, we can understand how lately more acute
logical thinking, the taking seriously of cause and effect, has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>developed; when our functions of reason and intelligence still reach
back involuntarily to those primitive forms of conclusion, and we
live about half our lives in this condition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already seen that Freud, independently of
Nietzsche, has reached a similar standpoint from the
basis of dream analysis. The step from this established
proposition to the perception of the myths as familiar
dream images is no longer a great one. Freud has formulated
this conclusion himself.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c008'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“The investigation of this folk-psychologic formation, myths,
etc., is by no means finished at present. To take an example of
this, however, it is probable that the myths correspond to the
distorted residue of wish phantasies of whole nations, the secularized
dreams of young humanity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rank<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c008'><sup>[37]</sup></a> understands the myths in a similar manner, as
a mass dream of the people.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c008'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Riklin<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c008'><sup>[39]</sup></a> has insisted
rightly upon the dream mechanism of the fables, and
Abraham<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c008'><sup>[40]</sup></a> has done the same for the myths. He says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The myth is a fragment of the infantile soul-life of the people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>and</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thus the myth is a <em>sustained, still remaining</em> fragment from
the infantile soul-life of the people, and the dream is the myth
of the individual.”</p>

<p class='c007'>An unprejudiced reading of the above-mentioned
authors will certainly allay all doubts concerning the
intimate connection between dream psychology and myth
psychology. The conclusion results almost from itself,
that the age which created the myths thought childishly—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>is to say, phantastically, as in our age is still done,
to a very great extent (associatively or analogically) in
dreams. The beginnings of myth formations (in the
child), the taking of phantasies for realities, which is
partly in accord with the historical, may easily be discovered
among children.</p>

<p class='c007'>One might raise the objection that the mythological
inclinations of children are implanted by education. The
objection is futile. Has humanity at all ever broken
loose from the myths? Every man has eyes and all his
senses to perceive that the world is dead, cold and unending,
and he has never yet seen a God, nor brought to
light the existence of such from empirical necessity. On
the contrary, there was need of a phantastic, indestructible
optimism, and one far removed from all sense of
reality, in order, for example, to discover in the shameful
death of Christ really the highest salvation and the redemption
of the world. Thus one can indeed withhold
from a child the substance of earlier myths but not take
from him the need for mythology. One can say, that
should it happen that all traditions in the world were cut
off with a single blow, then with the succeeding generation,
the whole mythology and history of religion would
start over again. Only a few individuals succeed in
throwing off mythology in a time of a certain intellectual
supremacy—the mass never frees itself. Explanations
are of no avail; they merely destroy a transitory form
of manifestation, but not the creating impulse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us again take up our earlier train of thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>We spoke of the ontogenetic re-echo of the phylogenetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>psychology among children, we saw that phantastic
thinking is a characteristic of antiquity, of the child,
and of the lower races; but now we know also that our
modern and adult man is given over in large part to
this same phantastic thinking, which enters as soon as the
directed thinking ceases. A lessening of the interest, a
slight fatigue, is sufficient to put an end to the directed
thinking, the exact psychological adaptation to the real
world, and to replace it with phantasies. We digress
from the theme and give way to our own trains of
thought; if the slackening of the attention increases, then
we lose by degrees the consciousness of the present, and
the phantasy enters into possession of the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the important question obtrudes itself: How are
phantasies created? From the poets we learn much about
it; from science we learn little. The psychoanalytic
method, presented to science by Freud, shed light upon
this for the first time. It showed us that there are
typical cycles. The stutterer imagines he is a great
orator. The truth of this, Demosthenes, thanks to his
energy, has proven. The poor man imagines himself to
be a millionaire, the child an adult. The conquered fight
out victorious battles with the conquerer; the unfit torments
or delights himself with ambitious plans. We
imagine that which we lack. The interesting question of
the “why” of all this we must here leave unanswered,
while we return to the historic problem: From what
source do the phantasies draw their materials?<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c008'><sup>[41]</sup></a> We
chose, as an example, a typical phantasy of puberty. A
child in that stage before whom the whole frightening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>uncertainty of the future fate opens, puts back the uncertainty
into the past, through his phantasy, and says, “If
only I were not the child of my ordinary parents, but
the child of a rich and fashionable count, and had been
merely passed over to my parents, then some day a golden
coach would come, and the count would take his child
back with him to his wonderful castle,” and so it goes
on, as in Grimm’s Fairy Tales which the mother tells to
her children.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c008'><sup>[42]</sup></a> With a normal child, it stops with the
fugitive, quickly-passing idea which is soon covered over
and forgotten. However, at one time, and that was in
the ancient world of culture, the phantasy was an openly
acknowledged institution. The heroes,—I recall Romulus
and Remus, Semiramis, Moses and many others,—have
been separated from their real parents.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c008'><sup>[43]</sup></a> Others
are directly sons of gods, and the noble races derive their
family trees from heroes and gods. As one sees by this
example, the phantasy of modern humanity is nothing but
a re-echo of an old-folk-belief, which was very widespread
originally.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c008'><sup>[44]</sup></a> The ambitious phantasy chooses,
among others, a form which is classic, and which once
had a true meaning. The same thing holds good in
regard to the sexual phantasy. In the preamble we have
spoken of dreams of sexual assault: the robber who
breaks into the house and commits a dangerous act.
That, too, is a mythological theme, and in the prehistoric
era was certainly a reality too.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c008'><sup>[45]</sup></a> Wholly apart from the
fact that the capture of women was something general
in the lawless prehistoric times, it was also a subject of
mythology in cultivated epochs. I recall the capture of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Proserpina, Deianira, Europa, the Sabine women, etc.
We must not forget that, even to-day, marriage customs
exist in various regions which recall the ancient custom
of marriage by capture.</p>

<p class='c007'>The symbolism of the instrument of coitus was an inexhaustible
material for ancient phantasy. It furnished
a widespread cult that was designated phallic, the object
of reverence of which was the phallus. The companion
of Dionysus was Phales, a personification of the phallus
proceeding from the phallic Herme of Dionysus. The
phallic symbols were countless. Among the Sabines, the
custom existed for the bridegroom to part the bride’s
hair with a lance. The bird, the fish and the snake were
phallic symbols. In addition, there existed in enormous
quantities theriomorphic representations of the sexual
instinct, in connection with which the bull, the he-goat,
the ram, the boar and the ass were frequently used. An
undercurrent to this choice of symbol was furnished by
the sodomitic inclination of humanity. When in the
dream phantasy of modern man, the feared man is replaced
by an animal, there is recurring in the ontogenetic
re-echo the same thing which was openly represented by
the ancients countless times. There were he-goats which
pursued nymphs, satyrs with she-goats; in still older times
in Egypt there even existed a shrine of a goat god, which
the Greeks called Pan, where the Hierodules prostituted
themselves with goats.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c008'><sup>[46]</sup></a> It is well known that this worship
has not died out, but continues to live as a special
custom in South Italy and Greece.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c008'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To-day we feel for such a thing nothing but the deepest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>abhorrence, and never would admit it still slumbered in
our souls. Nevertheless, just as truly as the idea of the
sexual assault is there, so are these things there too; which
we should contemplate still more closely,—not through
moral eye-glasses, with horror, but with interest as a
natural science, since these things are venerable relics of
past culture periods. We have, even to-day, a clause in
our penal code against sodomy. But that which was once
so strong as to give rise to a worship among a highly
developed people has probably not wholly disappeared
from the human soul during the course of a few generations.
We may not forget that since the symposium of
Plato, in which homo-sexuality faces us on the same level
with the so-called “normal sexuality,” only eighty generations
have passed. And what are eighty generations?
They shrink to an imperceptible period of time when
compared with the space of time which separates us from
the homo-Neandertalensis or Heidelbergensis. I might
call to mind, in this connection, some choice thoughts of
the great historian Guglielmo Ferrero:<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c008'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“It is a very common belief that the further man is separated
from the present by time, the more does he differ from us in his
thoughts and feelings; that the psychology of humanity changes
from century to century, like fashions of literature. Therefore, no
sooner do we find in past history an institution, a custom, a law
or a belief a little different from those with which we are familiar,
than we immediately search for some complex meanings, which
frequently resolve themselves into phrases of doubtful significance.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Indeed, man does not change so quickly; his psychology at
bottom remains the same, and even if his culture varies much from
one epoch to another, it does not change the functioning of his
mind. The fundamental laws of the mind remain the same, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>least during the short historical period of which we have knowledge,
and all phenomena, even the most strange, must be capable
of explanation by those common laws of the mind which we can
recognize in ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The psychologist should accept this viewpoint without
reservation as peculiarly applicable to himself. To-day,
indeed, in our civilization the phallic processions, the
Dionysian mysteries of classical Athens, the barefaced
Phallic emblems, have disappeared from our coins,
houses, temples and streets; so also have the theriomorphic
representations of the Deity been reduced to small
remnants, like the Dove of the Holy Ghost, the Lamb of
God and the Cock of Peter adorning our church towers.
In the same way, the capture and violation of women
have shrunken away to crimes. Yet all of this does not
affect the fact that we, in childhood, go through a period
in which the impulses toward these archaic inclinations
appear again and again, and that through all our life we
possess, side by side with the newly recruited, directed
and adapted thought, a phantastic thought which corresponds
to the thought of the centuries of antiquity and
barbarism. Just as our bodies still keep the reminders
of old functions and conditions in many old-fashioned
organs, so our minds, too, which apparently have outgrown
those archaic tendencies, nevertheless bear the
marks of the evolution passed through, and the very
ancient re-echoes, at least dreamily, in phantasies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The symbolism which Freud has discovered, is revealed
as an expression of a thinking and of an impulse
limited to the dream, to wrong conduct, and to derangements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>of the mind, which form of thinking and impulse at
one time ruled as the mightiest influence in past culture
epochs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of <em>whence</em> comes the inclination and
ability which enables the mind to express itself
symbolically, brings us to the distinction between the
two kinds of thinking—the directed and adapted on
one hand, and the subjective, fed by our own egotistic
wishes, on the other. The latter form of thinking,
presupposing that it were not constantly corrected
by the adapted thinking, must necessarily produce an
overwhelmingly subjectively distorted idea of the world.
We regard this state of mind as infantile. It lies in our
individual past, and in the past of mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this we affirm the important fact that man in his
phantastic thinking has kept a condensation of the psychic
history of his development. An extraordinarily important
task, which even to-day is hardly possible, is to give a
systematic description of phantastic thinking. One may,
at the most, sketch it. While directed thinking is a phenomenon
conscious throughout,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c008'><sup>[49]</sup></a> the same cannot be asserted
of phantastic thinking. Doubtless, a great part of
it still falls entirely in the realm of the conscious, but,
at least, just as much goes along in half shadows, and
generally an undetermined amount in the unconscious;
and this can, therefore, be disclosed only indirectly.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c008'><sup>[50]</sup></a> By
means of phantastic thinking, directed thinking is connected
with the oldest foundations of the human mind,
which have been for a long time beneath the threshold
of the consciousness. The products of this phantastic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>thinking arising directly from the consciousness are,
first, waking dreams, or day-dreams, to which Freud,
Flournoy, Pick and others have given special attention;
then the dreams which offer to the consciousness, at first,
a mysterious exterior, and win meaning only through the
indirectly inferred unconscious contents. Lastly, there is
a so-called wholly unconscious phantasy system in the
split-off complex, which exhibits a pronounced tendency
towards the production of a dissociated personality.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c008'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Our foregoing explanations show wherein the products
arising from the unconscious are related to the mythical.
From all these signs it may be concluded that the soul
possesses in some degree historical strata, the oldest
stratum of which would correspond to the unconscious.
The result of that must be that an introversion occurring
in later life, according to the Freudian teaching, seizes
upon regressive infantile reminiscences taken from the
individual past. That first points out the way; then, with
stronger introversion and regression (strong repressions,
introversion psychoses), there come to light pronounced
traits of an archaic mental kind which, under certain circumstances,
might go as far as the re-echo of a once
manifest, archaic mental product.</p>

<p class='c007'>This problem deserves to be more thoroughly discussed.
As a concrete example, let us take the history of
the pious Abbé Oegger which Anatole France has communicated
to us.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c008'><sup>[52]</sup></a> This priest was a hypercritical man,
and much given to phantasies, especially in regard to
one question, viz., the fate of Judas; whether he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>really damned, as the teaching of the church asserts, to
everlasting punishment, or whether God had pardoned
him after all. Oegger sided with the intelligent point of
view that God, in his all-wisdom, had chosen Judas as
an instrument, in order to bring about the highest point
of the work of redemption by Christ.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c008'><sup>[53]</sup></a> This necessary
instrument, without the help of which the human race
would not have been a sharer in salvation, could not
possibly be damned by the all-good God. In order to
put an end to his doubts, Oegger went one night to the
church, and made supplication for a sign that Judas was
saved. Then he felt a heavenly touch upon his shoulder.
Following this, Oegger told the Archbishop of his resolution
to go out into the world to preach God’s unending
mercy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we have a richly developed phantasy system before
us. It is concerned with the subtle and perpetually
undecided question as to whether the legendary figure of
Judas is damned or not. The Judas legend is, in itself,
mythical material, viz., the malicious betrayal of a hero.
I recall Siegfried and Hagen, Balder and Loki. Siegfried
and Balder were murdered by a faithless traitor from
among their closest associates. This myth is moving and
tragic—it is not honorable battle which kills the noble,
but evil treachery. It is, too, an occurrence which is historical
over and over again. One thinks of Cæsar and
Brutus. Since the myth of such a deed is very old, and
still the subject of teaching and repetition, it is the
expression of a psychological fact, that envy does not
allow humanity to sleep, and that all of us carry, in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>hidden recess of our heart, a deadly wish towards the
hero. This rule can be applied generally to mythical
tradition. <em>It does not set forth any account of the old
events, but rather acts in such a way that it always reveals
a thought common to humanity, and once more rejuvenated.</em>
Thus, for example, the lives and deeds of the
founders of old religions are the purest condensations
of typical, contemporaneous myths, behind which the
individual figure entirely disappears.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c008'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But why does our pious Abbé torment himself with the
old Judas legend? He first went into the world to preach
the gospel of mercy, and then, after some time, he
separated from the Catholic church and became a Swedenborgian.
Now we understand his Judas phantasy. <em>He
was the Judas</em> who betrayed his Lord. Therefore, first
of all, he had to make sure of the divine mercy, in order
to be Judas in peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>This case throws a light upon the mechanism of the
phantasies in general. The known, conscious phantasy
may be of mythical or other material; it is not to be taken
seriously as such, for it has an indirect meaning. If we
take it, however, as important per se, then the thing is
not understandable, and makes one despair of the efficiency
of the mind. But we saw, in the case of Abbé
Oegger, that his doubts and his hopes did not turn upon
the historical problem of Judas, but upon his own personality,
which wished to win a way to freedom for itself
through the solution of the Judas problem.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The conscious phantasies tell us of mythical or other
material of undeveloped or no longer recognized wish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>tendencies in the soul.</em> As is easily to be understood, an
innate tendency, an acknowledgment of which one refuses
to make, and which one treats as non-existent, can
hardly contain a thing that may be in accord with our
conscious character. It concerns the tendencies which are
considered immoral, and as generally impossible, and the
strongest resentment is felt towards bringing them into
the consciousness. What would Oegger have said had
he been told confidentially that he was preparing himself
for the Judas rôle? And what in ourselves do we consider
immoral and non-existent, or which we at least wish
were non-existent? It is that which in antiquity lay widespread
on the surface, viz., sexuality in all its various
manifestations. Therefore, we need not wonder in the
least when we find this at the base of most of our phantasies,
even if the phantasies have a different appearance.
Because Oegger found the damnation of Judas incompatible
with God’s goodness, he thought about the conflict
in that way; that is the conscious sequence. Along
with this is the unconscious sequence; because Oegger
himself wished to be a Judas, he first made sure of the
goodness of God. To Oegger, Judas was the symbol
of his own unconscious tendency, and he made use of this
symbol in order to be able to meditate over his unconscious
wish. The direct coming into consciousness of the
Judas wish would have been too painful for him. <em>Thus,
there must be typical myths which are really the instruments
of a folk-psychological complex treatment.</em> Jacob
Burckhardt seems to have suspected this when he once
said that every Greek of the classical era carried in himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>a fragment of the Oedipus, just as every German
carries a fragment of Faust.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c008'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The problem which the simple story of the Abbé
Oegger has brought clearly before us confronts us again
when we prepare to examine phantasies which owe their
existence this time to an exclusively unconscious work.
We are indebted for the material which we will use in
the following chapters to the useful publication of an
American woman, Miss Frank Miller, who has given to
the world some poetical unconsciously formed phantasies
under the title, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelque faits d’imagination créatrice
subconsciente.</span>”—<em>Vol. V., Archives de Psychologie,
1906.</em><a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c008'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>
  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>THE MILLER PHANTASIES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We know, from much psychoanalytic experience, that
whenever one recounts his phantasies or his dreams, he
deals not only with the most important and intimate of
his problems, but with the one the most painful at that
moment.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c008'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Since in the case of Miss Miller we have to do with a
complicated system, we must give our attention carefully
to the particulars which I will discuss, following as best
I can Miss Miller’s presentation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first chapter, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Phénomènes de suggestion passagère
ou d’autosuggestion instantanée</span>,” Miss Miller
gives a list of examples of her unusual suggestibility,
which she herself considers as a symptom of her nervous
temperament; for example, she is excessively fond of
caviar, whereas some of her relatives loathe it. However,
as soon as any one expresses his loathing, she herself
feels momentarily the same loathing. I do not need
to emphasize especially the fact that such examples are
very important in individual psychology; that caviar is
a food for which nervous women frequently have an
especial predilection, is a fact well known to the psychoanalyst.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller has an extraordinary faculty for taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>other people’s feelings upon herself, and of identification;
for example, she identifies herself to such a degree
in “Cyrano” with the wounded Christian de Neuvillette,
that she feels in her own breast a truly piercing pain at
that place where Christian received the deadly blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the viewpoint of analytic psychology, the theatre,
aside from any esthetic value, may be considered as an
institution for the treatment of the mass complex. The
enjoyment of the comedy, or of the dramatic plot ending
happily is produced by an unreserved identification of
one’s own complexes with the play. The enjoyment of
tragedy lies in the thrilling yet satisfactory feeling that
something which might occur to one’s self is happening
to another. The sympathy of our author with the dying
Christian means that there is in her a complex awaiting
a similar solution, which whispers softly to her “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">hodie
tibi, cras mihi</span>,” and that one may know exactly what is
considered the effectual moment Miss Miller adds that
she felt a pain in her breast, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lorsque Sarah Bernhardt
se précipite sur lui pour étancher le sang de sa blessure.</span>”
Therefore the effectual moment is when the love between
Christian and Roxane comes to a sudden end.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we glance over the whole of Rostand’s play, we
come upon certain moments, the effect of which one cannot
easily escape and which we will emphasize here because
they have meaning for all that follows. Cyrano de
Bergerac, with the long ugly nose, on account of which
he undertakes countless duels, loves Roxane, who, for
her part unaware of it, loves Christian, because of the
beautiful verses which really originate from Cyrano’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>pen, but which apparently come from Christian. Cyrano
is the misunderstood one, whose passionate love and
noble soul no one suspects; the hero who sacrifices himself
for others, and, dying, just in the evening of life,
reads to her once more Christian’s last letter, the verses
which he himself had composed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cyrano, who under the hateful exterior of his body
hid a soul so much more beautiful, is a yearner and one
misunderstood, and his last triumph is that he departs,
at least, with a clean shield—“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sans un pli et sans une
tache.</span>” The identification of the author with the dying
Christian, who in himself is a figure but little impressive
and sympathetic, expresses clearly that a sudden end is
destined for her love just as for Christian’s love. The
tragic intermezzo with Christian, however, is played as
we have seen upon a background of much wider significance,
viz., the misunderstood love of Cyrano for
Roxane. Therefore, the identification with Christian
has only the significance of a substitute memory (“deckerinnerung”),
and is really intended for Cyrano. That
this is just what we might expect will be seen in the
further course of our analysis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides this story of identification with Christian, there
follows as a further example an extraordinarily plastic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>memory of the sea, evoked by the sight of a photograph of
a steamboat on the high seas. (“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je sentis les pulsations
des machines, le soulèvement des vagues, le balancement
du navire.</span>”)</p>

<p class='c007'>We may mention here the supposition that there are
connected with sea journeys particularly impressive and
strong memories which penetrate deeply into the soul
and give an especially strong character to the surface
memories through unconscious harmony. To what extent
the memories assumed here agree with the above mentioned
problem we shall see in the following pages.</p>

<p class='c007'>This example, following at this time, is singular: Once,
while in bathing, Miss Miller wound a towel around her
hair, in order to protect it from a wetting. At the same
moment she had the following strong impression:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il me sembla que j’étais sur un piédestal, une véritable statue
égyptienne, avec tous ses détails: membres raides, un pied en
avant, la main tenant des insignes</span>,” and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller identified herself, therefore, with an Egyptian
statue, and naturally the foundation for this was
a subjective pretension. That is to say, “I am like an
Egyptian statue, just as stiff, wooden, sublime and impassive,”
qualities for which the Egyptian statue is proverbial.
One does not make such an assertion to one’s
self without an inner compulsion, and the correct formula
might just as well be, “as stiff, wooden, etc., as an Egyptian
statue I might indeed be.” The sight of one’s own
unclothed body in a bath has undeniable effects for the
phantasy, which can be set at rest by the above formula.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c008'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The example which follows this, emphasizes the
author’s personal influence upon an artist:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’ai réussi à lui faire rendre des paysages, comme ceux du
lac Léman, où il n’a jamais été, et il prétendait que je pouvais
lui faire rendre des choses qu’il n’avait jamais vues, et lui donner
la sensation d’une atmosphère ambiante qu’il n’avait jamais sentie;
bref que je me servais de lui comme lui-même se servait de son
crayon, c’est à dire comme d’un simple instrument.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>This observation stands in abrupt contrast to the phantasy
of the Egyptian statue. Miss Miller had here the
unspoken need of emphasizing her almost magic effect
upon another person. This could not have happened,
either, without an unconscious need, which is particularly
felt by one who does not often succeed in making an
emotional impression upon a fellow being.</p>

<p class='c007'>With that, the list of examples which are to picture
Miss Miller’s autosuggestibility and suggestive effect, is
exhausted. In this respect, the examples are neither
especially striking nor interesting. From an analytical
viewpoint, on the contrary, they are much more important,
since they afford us a glance into the soul of the
writer. Ferenczi<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c008'><sup>[59]</sup></a> has taught us in an excellent work
what is to be thought about suggestibility, that is to say,
that these phenomena win new aspects in the light of the
Freudian libido theory, in so much as their effects become
clear through “Libido-besetzungen.” This was already
indicated above in the discussion of the examples,
and in the greatest detail regarding the identification
with Christian. The identification becomes effective by
its receiving an influx of energy from the strongly accentuated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>thought and emotional feeling underlying the
Christian motif. Just the reverse is the suggestive effect
of the individual in an especial capacity for concentrating
interest (that is to say, libido) upon another person, by
which the other is unconsciously compelled to reaction
(the same or opposed). The majority of the examples
concern cases where Miss Miller is put under the effects
of suggestion; that is to say, when the libido has spontaneously
gained possession of certain impressions, and
this is impossible if the libido is dammed up to an unusual
degree by the lack of application to reality. Miss
Miller’s observations about suggestibility inform us,
therefore, of the fact that the author is pleased to tell
us in her following phantasies something of the history
of her love.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>THE HYMN OF CREATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The second chapter in Miss Miller’s work is entitled,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gloire à Dieu. Poème onirique.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>When twenty years of age, Miss Miller took a long
journey through Europe. We leave the description of it
to her:</p>

<p class='c017'>“After a long and rough journey from New York to Stockholm,
from there to Petersburg and Odessa, I found it a true
pleasure<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c008'><sup>[60]</sup></a> to leave the world of inhabited cities—and to enter
the world of waves, sky and silence—I stayed hours long on deck
to dream, stretched out in a reclining chair. The histories, legends
and myths of the different countries which I saw in the distance,
came back to me indistinctly blended together in a sort of
luminous mist, in which things lost their reality, while the dreams
and thoughts alone took on somewhat the appearance of reality.
At first, I even avoided all company and kept to myself, lost
wholly in my dreams, where all that I knew of great, beautiful
and good came back into my consciousness with new strength and
new life. I also employed a great part of my time writing to my
distant friends, reading and sketching out short poems about the
regions visited. Some of these poems were of a very serious
character.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It may seem superfluous, perhaps, to enter intimately
into all these details. If we recall, however, the remark
made above,—that when people let their unconscious
speak, they always tell us the most important things of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>their intimate selves—then even the smallest detail appears
to have meaning. Valuable personalities invariably
tell us, through their unconscious, things that are generally
valuable, so that patient interest is rewarded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller describes here a state of “introversion.”
After the life of the cities with their many impressions
had been absorbing her interest (with that already discussed
strength of suggestion which powerfully enforced
the impression) she breathed freely upon the ocean, and
after so many external impressions, became engrossed
wholly in the internal with intentional abstraction from
the surroundings, so that things lost their reality and
dreams became truth. We know from psychopathology
that certain mental disturbances<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c008'><sup>[61]</sup></a> exist which are first
manifested by the individuals shutting themselves off
slowly, more and more, from reality and sinking into
their phantasies, during which process, in proportion as
the reality loses its hold, the inner world gains in reality
and determining power.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c008'><sup>[62]</sup></a> This process leads to a certain
point (which varies with the individual) when the patients
suddenly become more or less conscious of their
separation from reality. The event which then enters
is the pathological excitation: that is to say, the patients
begin to turn towards the environment, with diseased
views (to be sure) which, however, still represent the
compensating, although unsuccessful, attempt at transference.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c008'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
The methods of reaction are, naturally, very
different. I will not concern myself more closely about
this here.</p>

<p class='c007'>This type appears to be generally a psychological rule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>which holds good for all neuroses and, therefore, also
for the normal in a much less degree. We might, therefore,
expect that Miss Miller, after this energetic and persevering
introversion, which had even encroached for a
time upon the feeling of reality, would succumb anew to
an impression of the real world and also to just as suggestive
and energetic an influence as that of her dreams.
Let us proceed with the narrative:</p>

<p class='c017'>“But as the journey drew to an end, the ship’s officers outdid
themselves in kindness (tout ce qu’il y a de plus empressé et de plus
aimable) and I passed many amusing hours teaching them English.
On the Sicilian coast, in the harbor of Catania, I wrote a sailor’s
song which was very similar to a song well known on the sea,
(Brine, wine and damsels fine). The Italians in general all sing
very well, and one of the officers who sang on deck during night
watch, had made a great impression upon me and had given me
the idea of writing some words adapted to his melody. Soon
after that, I was very nearly obliged to reverse the well-known
saying, ‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Veder Napoli e poi morir</span>,’—that is to say, suddenly I
became very ill, although not dangerously so. I recovered to
such an extent, however, that I could go on land to visit the
sights of the city in a carriage. This day tired me very much,
and since we had planned to see Pisa the following day, I went
on board early in the evening and soon lay down to sleep without
thinking of anything more serious than the beauty of the officers
and the ugliness of the Italian beggars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One is somewhat disappointed at meeting here, instead
of the expected impression of reality, rather a small intermezzo,
a flirtation. Nevertheless, one of the officers,
the singer, had made a great impression (il m’avait fait
beaucoup d’impression). The remark at the close of the
description, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans songer à rien de plus sérieux qu’à la
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>beauté des officiers</span>,” and so on, diminishes the seriousness
of the impression, it is true. The assumption, however,
that the impression openly influenced the mood very
much, is supported by the fact that a poem upon a subject
of such an erotic character came forth immediately,
“Brine, wine and damsels fine,” and in the singer’s honor.
One is only too easily inclined to take such an impression
lightly, and one admits so gladly the statements of the
participators when they represent everything as simple
and not at all serious. I dwell upon this impression at
length, because it is important to know that an erotic impression
after such an introversion, has a deep effect and
is undervalued, possibly, by Miss Miller. The suddenly
passing sickness is obscure and needs a psychologic interpretation
which cannot be touched upon here because of
lack of data. The phenomena now to be described can
only be explained as arising from a disturbance which
reaches to the very depths of her being.</p>

<p class='c017'>“From Naples to Livorno, the ship travelled for a night,
during which I slept more or less well,—my sleep, however, is
seldom deep or dreamless. It seemed to me as if my mother’s
voice wakened me, just at the end of the following dream. At
first I had a vague conception of the words, ‘When the morning
stars sang together,’ which were the praeludium of a certain confused
representation of creation and of the mighty chorals resounding
through the universe. In spite of the strange, contradictory
and confused character which is peculiar to the dream,
there was mingled in it the chorus of an oratorio which has been
given by one of the foremost musical societies of New York, and
with that were also memories of Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost.’ Then
from out of this whirl, there slowly emerged certain words, which
arranged themselves into three strophes and, indeed, they seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>to be in my own handwriting on ordinary blue-lined writing paper
on a page of my old poetry book which I always carried around with
me; in short, they appeared to me exactly as some minutes later
they were in reality in my book.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller now wrote down the following poem,
which she rearranged somewhat a few months later, to
make it more nearly, in her opinion, like the dream
original.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When the Eternal first made Sound</div>
      <div class='line'>A myriad ears sprang out to hear,</div>

      <div class='line'>There rolled an echo deep and clear:</div>
      <div class='line'>All glory to the God of Sound!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When the Eternal first made Light</div>

      <div class='line'>“When the Eternal first gave Love</div>

      <div class='line'>All glory to the God of Love!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Before we enter upon Miss Miller’s attempt to bring
to light through her suppositions<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c008'><sup>[64]</sup></a> the root of this subliminal
creation, we will attempt a short analytic survey
of the material already in our possession. The impression
on the ship has already been properly emphasized,
so that we need have no further difficulty in gaining possession
of the dynamic process which brought about this
poetical revelation. It was made clear in the preceding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>paragraphs that Miss Miller possibly had not inconsiderably
undervalued the importance of the erotic impression.
This assumption gains in probability through experience,
which shows that, very generally, relatively
weak erotic impressions are greatly undervalued. One
can see this best in cases where those concerned, either
from social or moral grounds, consider an erotic relation
as something quite impossible; for example, parents and
children, brothers and sisters, relations (homosexual)
between older and younger men, and so on. If the impression
is relatively slight, then it does not exist at all
for the participators; if the impression is strong, then a
tragic dependence arises, which may result in some great
nonsense, or be carried to any extent. This lack of understanding
can go unbelievably far; mothers, who see the
first erections of the small son in their own bed, a sister
who half-playfully embraces her brother, a twenty-year-old
daughter who still seats herself on her father’s lap,
and then has “strange” sensations in her “abdomen.”
They are all morally indignant to the highest degree if
one speaks of “sexuality.” Finally, our whole education
is carried on with the tacit agreement to know as little
as possible of the erotic, and to spread abroad the deepest
ignorance in regard to it. It is no wonder, therefore,
that the judgment, <em>in puncto</em>, of the importance of an
erotic impression is generally unsafe and inadequate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller was under the influence of a deep erotic
impression, as we have seen. Because of the sum-total
of the feelings aroused by this, it does not seem that this
impression was more than dimly realized, for the dream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>had to contain a powerful repetition. From analytic experience,
one knows that the early dreams which patients
bring for analysis are none the less of especial interest,
because of the fact that they bring out criticisms and
valuations of the physician’s personality, which previously,
would have been asked for directly in vain. They
enrich the conscious impression which the patient had of
his physician, and often concerning very important points.
They are naturally erotic observations which the unconscious
was forced to make, just because of the quite universal
undervaluation and uncertain judgment of the
relatively weak erotic impression. In the drastic and
hyperbolic manner of expression of the dream, the impression
often appears in almost unintelligible form on account
of the immeasurable dimension of the symbol. A further
peculiarity which seems to rest upon the historic strata of
the unconscious, is this—that an erotic impression, to
which conscious acknowledgment is denied, usurps an
earlier and discarded transference and expresses itself
in that. Therefore, it frequently happens, for example,
that among young girls at the time of their first love,
remarkable difficulties develop in the capacity for erotic
expression, which may be reduced analytically to disturbances
through a regressive attempt at resuscitation of
the father image, or the “Father-Imago.”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c008'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Indeed, one might presume something similar in Miss
Miller’s case, for the idea of the masculine creative deity
is a derivation, analytically and historically psychologic,
of the “Father-Imago,”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c008'><sup>[66]</sup></a> and aims, above all, to replace
the discarded infantile father transference in such a way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>that for the individual the passing from the narrow circle
of the family into the wider circle of human society may
be simpler or made easier.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the light of this reflection, we can see, in the poem
and its “Praeludium,” the religious, poetically formed
product of an introversion depending upon the surrogate
of the “Father-Imago.” In spite of the incomplete apperception
of the effectual impression, essential component
parts of this are included in the idea of compensation,
as marks, so to speak, of its origin. (Pfister has
coined for this the striking expression, “Law of the Return
of the Complex.”) The effectual impression was
that of the officer singing in the night watch, “When the
morning stars sang together.” The idea of this opened
a new world to the girl. (Creation.)</p>

<p class='c007'>This creator has created tone, then light, and then
love. That the first to be created should have been tone,
can be made clear only individually, for there is no cosmogony
except the Gnosis of Hermes, a generally quite
unknown system, which would have such tendencies. But
now we might venture a conjecture, which is already apparent,
and which soon will be proven thoroughly, viz.,
the following chain of associations: the singer—the singing
morning stars—the God of tone—the Creator—the
God of Light—(of the sun)—(of the fire)—and of Love.</p>

<p class='c007'>The links of this chain are proven by the material, with
the exception of sun and fire, which I put in parentheses,
but which, however, will be proven through what follows
in the further course of the analysis. All of these expressions,
with one exception, belong to erotic speech. (“My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>God, star, light; my sun, fire of love, fiery love,” etc.)
“Creator” appears indistinct at first, but becomes understandable
through the reference to the undertone of Eros,
to the vibrating chord of Nature, which attempts to renew
itself in every pair of lovers, and awaits the wonder of
creation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller had taken pains to disclose the unconscious
creation of her mind to her understanding, and, indeed
through a procedure which agrees in principle with
psychoanalysis, and, therefore, leads to the same results
as psychoanalysis. But, as usually happens with laymen
and beginners, Miss Miller, because she had no knowledge
of psychoanalysis, left off at the thoughts which
necessarily bring the deep complex lying at the bottom
of it to light in an indirect, that is to say, censored manner.
More than this, a simple method, merely the carrying
out of the thought to its conclusion, is sufficient to discover
the meaning. Miss Miller finds it astonishing that
her unconscious phantasy does not, following the Mosaic
account of creation, put light in the first place, instead of
tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now follows an explanation, theoretically constructed
and correct ad hoc, the hollowness of which is, however,
characteristic of all similar attempts at explanation. She
says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is perhaps interesting to recall that Anaxagoras also had
the Cosmos arise out of chaos through a sort of whirlwind, which
does not happen usually without producing sound.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c008'><sup>[67]</sup></a> But at this
time I had studied no philosophy, and knew nothing either of
Anaxagoras or of his theories about the ‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</span>,’ which I, unconsciously,
was openly following. At that time, also, I was equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>in complete ignorance of Leibnitz, and, therefore, knew nothing
of his doctrine ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dum Deus calculat, fit mundus</span>.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller’s references to Anaxagoras and to Leibnitz
both refer to creation by means of thought; that is
to say, that divine thought alone could bring forth a new
material reality, a reference at first not intelligible, but
which will soon, however, be more easily understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now come to those fancies from which Miss Miller
principally drew her unconscious creation.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In the first place, there is the ‘Paradise Lost’ by Milton,
which we had at home in the edition illustrated by Doré, and
which had often delighted me from childhood. Then the ‘Book
of Job,’ which had been read aloud to me since the time of my
earliest recollection. Moreover, if one compares the first words
of ‘Paradise Lost’ with my first verse, one notices that there
is the same verse measure.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My poem also recalls various passages in Job, and one or two
places in Handel’s Oratorio ‘The Creation,’ which came out
very indistinctly in the first part of the dream.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c008'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The “Lost Paradise” which, as is well known, is so
closely connected with the beginning of the world, is
made more clearly evident by the verse—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Of man’s first disobedience”</p>

<p class='c007'>which is concerned evidently with the fall, the meaning
of which need not be shown any further. I know the
objection which every one unacquainted with psychoanalysis
will raise, viz., that Miss Miller might just as
well have chosen any other verse as an example, and that,
accidentally, she had taken the first one that happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>to appear which had this content, also accidentally. As
is well known, the criticism which we hear equally from
our medical colleagues, and from our patients, is generally
based on such arguments. This misunderstanding
arises from the fact that the law of causation in the
psychical sphere is not taken seriously enough; that is to
say, there are no accidents, no “just as wells.” It is so,
and there is, therefore, a sufficient reason at hand why
it is so. It is moreover true that Miss Miller’s poem is
connected with the fall, wherein just that erotic component
comes forth, the existence of which we have surmised
above.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller neglects to tell which passages in Job
occurred to her mind. These, unfortunately, are therefore
only general suppositions. Take first, the analogy
to the Lost Paradise. Job lost all that he had, and this
was due to an act of Satan, who wished to incite him
against God. In the same way mankind, through the
temptation of the serpent, lost Paradise, and was plunged
into earth’s torments. The idea, or rather the mood
which is expressed by the reference to the Lost Paradise,
is Miss Miller’s feeling that she had lost something
which was connected with satanic temptation. To her it
happened, just as to Job, that she suffered innocently, for
she did not fall a victim to temptation. Job’s sufferings
are not understood by his friends;<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c008'><sup>[69]</sup></a> no one knows that
Satan has taken a hand in the game, and that Job is truly
innocent. Job never tires of avowing his innocence. Is
there a hint in that? We know that certain neurotic and
especially mentally diseased people continually defend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>their innocence against non-existent attacks; however, one
discovers at a closer examination that the patient, while
he apparently defends his innocence without reason, fulfils
with that a “Deckhandlung,” the energy for which arises
from just those impulses, whose sinful character is revealed
by the contents of the pretended reproach and
calumny.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c008'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Job suffered doubly, on one side through the loss of his
fortune, on the other through the lack of understanding
in his friends; the latter can be seen throughout the book.
The suffering of the misunderstood recalls the figure of
Cyrano de Bergerac—he too suffered doubly, on one side
through hopeless love, on the other side through misunderstanding.
He falls, as we have seen, in the last hopeless
battle against “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Mensonge, les Compromis, les
Préjugés, les Lâchetés et la Sottise.—Oui, Vous m’arrachez
tout le laurier et la rose!</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Job laments</p>

      <div class='line'>He runneth upon me like a giant.”—<em>Job</em> xvi: 11–15.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The analogy of feeling lies in the suffering of the hopeless
struggle against the more powerful. It is as if this
conflict were accompanied from afar by the sounds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“creation,” which brings up a beautiful and mysterious
image belonging to the unconscious, and which has not
yet forced its way up to the light of the upper world.
We surmise, rather than know, that this battle has really
something to do with creation, with the struggles between
negations and affirmations. The references to Rostand’s
“Cyrano” through the identification with Christian, to
Milton’s “Paradise Lost,” to the sorrows of Job, misunderstood
by his friends, betray plainly that in the soul
of the poet something was identified with these ideas. She
also has suffered like Cyrano and Job, has lost paradise,
and dreams of “creation,”—creation by means of thought—fruition
through the whirlwind of Anaxagoras.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c008'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>We once more submit ourselves to Miss Miller’s
guidance:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I remember that when fifteen years old, I was once very
much stirred up over an article, read aloud to me by my mother,
concerning the idea which spontaneously produced its object. I
was so excited that I could not sleep all night because of thinking
over and over again what that could mean.</p>

<p class='c017'>“From the age of nine to sixteen, I went every Sunday to a
Presbyterian Church, in charge of which, at that time, was a very
cultured minister. In one of the earliest memories which I have
retained of him, I see myself as a very small girl sitting in a
very large pew, continually endeavoring to keep myself awake and
pay attention, without in the least being able to understand
what he meant when he spoke to us of Chaos, Cosmos and the
Gift of Love (don d’amour).”</p>

<p class='c007'>There are also rather early memories of the awakening
of puberty (nine to sixteen) which have connected
the idea of the cosmos springing from chaos with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">don d’amour.</span>” The medium in which these associations
occur is the memory of a certain very much honored
ecclesiastic who spoke those dark words. From the same
period of time comes the remembrance of that excitement
about the idea of the “creative thought” which from
itself “produced its object.” Here are two ways of creation
intimated: the creative thought, and the mysterious
reference to the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">don d’amour.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time when I had not yet understood the nature
of psychoanalysis, I had a fortunate opportunity of winning
through continual observation a deep insight into
the soul of a fifteen-year-old girl. Then I discovered,
with astonishment, what the contents of the unconscious
phantasies are, and how far removed they are from those
which a girl of that age shows outwardly. There are
wide-reaching phantasies of truly mythical fruitfulness.
The girl was, in the split-off phantasy, the race-mother
of uncounted peoples.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c008'><sup>[72]</sup></a> If we deduct the poetically
spoken phantasy of the girl, elements are left which at
that age are common to all girls, for the unconscious content
is to an infinitely greater degree common to all mankind
than the content of the individual consciousness.
For it is the condensation of that which is historically the
average and ordinary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller’s problem at this age was the common
human problem: “How am I to be creative?” Nature
knows but one answer to that: “Through the child (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">don
d’amour!</span>).” “But how is the child attained?” Here
the terrifying problem emerges, which, as our analytic
experience shows, is connected with the father,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c008'><sup>[73]</sup></a> where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>it cannot be solved; because the original sin of incest
weighs heavily for all time upon the human race. The
strong and natural love which binds the child to the
father, turns away in those years during which the
humanity of the father would be all too plainly recognized,
to the higher forms of the father, to the “Fathers”
of the church, and to the Father God,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c008'><sup>[74]</sup></a> visibly represented
by them, and in that there lies still less possibility
of solving the problem. However, mythology is not lacking
in consolations. Has not the <em>logos</em> become flesh
too? Has not the divine <em>pneuma</em>, even the <em>logos</em>, entered
the Virgin’s womb and lived among us as the son
of man? That whirlwind of Anaxagoras was precisely
the divine <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</span> which from out of itself has become
the world. Why do we cherish the image of the Virgin
Mother even to this day? Because it is always comforting
and says without speech or noisy sermon to the one
seeking comfort, “I too have become a mother,”—through
the “idea which spontaneously produces its
object.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I believe that there is foundation enough at hand for a
sleepless night, if those phantasies peculiar to the age of
puberty were to become possessed of this idea—the results
would be immeasurable! All that is psychologic has an
under and an over meaning, as is expressed in the profound
remark of the old mystic: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐρανὸς ἄνο, οὐρανὸς
κάτο, αἰθέρα ἄνο, αἰθέρα κάτο, πᾶν τοῦτο ἄνο, πᾶν
τοῦτο κάτο, τοῦτο λαβὲ καὶ εὐτυχει</span><a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c008'><sup>[75]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>We would show but slight justice, however, to the intellectual
originality of our author, if we were satisfied
to trace back the commotion of that sleepless night absolutely
and entirely to the sexual problem in a narrow
sense. That would be but one-half, and truly, to make
use of the mystic’s expression, only the under half. The
other half is the intellectual sublimation, which strives
to make true in its own way the ambiguous expression of
“the idea which produces its object spontaneously,”—<em>ideal
creation in place of the real</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In such an intellectual accomplishment of an evidently
very capable personality, the prospect of a spiritual fruitfulness
is something which is worthy of the highest aspiration,
since for many it will become a necessity of life.
Also this side of the phantasy explains, to a great extent,
the excitement, for it is a thought with a presentiment
of the future; one of those thoughts which arise,
to use one of Maeterlinck’s expressions,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c008'><sup>[76]</sup></a> from the “inconscient
supérieur,” that “prospective potency” of subliminal
combinations.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c008'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I have had the opportunity of observing certain cases
of neuroses of years’ duration, in which, at the time of
the beginning of the illness or shortly before, a dream
occurred, often of visionary clarity. This impressed
itself inextinguishably upon the memory, and in analysis
revealed a hidden meaning to the patient which anticipated
the subsequent events of life; that is to say, their
psychologic meaning.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c008'><sup>[78]</sup></a> I am inclined to grant this meaning
to the commotion of that restless night, because the
resulting events of life, in so far as Miss Miller consciously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>and unconsciously unveils them to us, are entirely
of a nature to confirm the supposition that that moment
is to be considered as the inception and presentiment of
a sublimated aim in life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller concludes the list of her fancies with the
following remarks:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The dream seemed to me to come from a mixture of the
representation of ‘Paradise Lost,’ ‘Job,’ and ‘Creation,’ with
ideas such as ‘thought which spontaneously produces its object’:
‘the gift of love,’ ‘chaos, and cosmos.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same way as colored splinters of glass are combined
in a kaleidoscope, in her mind fragments of philosophy,
æsthetics and religion would seem to be combined—</p>

<p class='c017'>“under the stimulating influence of the journey, and the countries
hurriedly seen, combined with the great silence and the indescribable
charm of the sea. ‘Ce ne fut que cela et rien de plus.’
‘Only this, and nothing more!’”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words, Miss Miller shows us out, politely
and energetically. Her parting words in her negation,
confirmed over again in English, leave behind a curiosity;
viz., what position is to be negated by these words? “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce
ne fut que cela et rien de plus</span>”—that is to say, really,
only “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le charme impalpable de la mer</span>”—and the young
man who sang melodiously during the night watch is long
since forgotten, and no one is to know, least of all the
dreamer, that he was a morning star, who came before
the creation of a new day.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c008'><sup>[79]</sup></a> One should take care lest
he satisfy himself and the reader with a sentence such as
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce ne fut que cela.</span>” Otherwise, it might immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>happen that one would become disturbed again. This
occurs to Miss Miller too, since she allowed an English
quotation to follow,—“Only this, and nothing more,”
without giving the source, it is true. The quotation comes
from an unusually effective poem, “The Raven” by Poe.
The line referred to occurs in the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping</div>
      <div class='line'>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘’Tis some visitor.’ I muttered, ‘tapping at my chamber door’—</div>
      <div class='line in20'>Only this, and nothing more.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The spectral raven knocks nightly at his door and
reminds the poet of his irrevocably lost “Lenore.” The
raven’s name is “Nevermore,” and as a refrain to every
verse he croaks his horrible “Nevermore.” Old memories
come back tormentingly, and the spectre repeats inexorably
“Nevermore.” The poet seeks in vain to
frighten away the dismal guest; he calls to the raven:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend,’ I shrieked, upstarting—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Get thee back into the tempest and the night’s Plutonian shore!</div>
      <div class='line'>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</div>
      <div class='line'>Leave my loneliness unbroken, quit the bust above my door!</div>
      <div class='line'>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!’</div>
      <div class='line in20'>Quoth the raven, ‘Nevermore.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That quotation, which, apparently, skips lightly over
the situation, “Only this, and nothing more,” comes from
a text which depicts in an affecting manner the despair
over the lost Lenore. That quotation also misleads our
poet in the most striking manner. Therefore, she undervalues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the erotic impression and the wide-reaching effect
of the commotion caused by it. It is this undervaluation,
which Freud has formulated more precisely as “repression,”
which is the reason why the erotic problem does
not attain directly conscious treatment, and from this
there arise “these psychologic riddles.” The erotic impression
works in the unconscious, and, in its stead, pushes
symbols forth into consciousness. Thus, one plays hide-and-seek
with one’s self. First, it is “the morning stars
which sing together”; then “Paradise Lost”; then the
erotic yearning clothes itself in an ecclesiastical dress and
utters dark words about “World Creation” and finally
rises into a religious hymn to find there, at last, a way out
into freedom, a way against which the censor of the moral
personality can oppose nothing more. The hymn contains
in its own peculiar character the marks of its origin.
It thus has fulfilled itself—the “Law of the Return of
the Complex.” The night singer, in this circuitous manner
of the old transference to the Father-Priest, has become
the “Eternal,” the “Creator,” the <em>God of Tone,
of Light, of Love</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The indirect course of the libido seems to be a way
of sorrow; at least “Paradise Lost” and the parallel
reference to Job lead one to that conclusion. If we take,
in addition to this, the introductory intimation of the
identification with Christian, which we see concludes with
Cyrano, then we are furnished with material which pictures
the indirect course of the libido as truly a way of
sorrow. It is the same as when mankind, after the sinful
fall, had the burden of the earthly life to bear, or like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the tortures of Job, who suffered under the power of
Satan and of God, and who himself, without suspecting it,
became a plaything of the superhuman forces which we
no longer consider as metaphysical, but as metapsychological.
Faust also offers us the same exhibition of
God’s wager.</p>

<p class='c017'><em>Mephistopheles</em>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What will you bet? There’s still a chance to gain him</div>
      <div class='line'>If unto me full leave you give</div>
      <div class='line'>Gently upon my road to train him!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><em>Satan</em>:</p>

<p class='c017'>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath,
and he will curse thee to thy face.—<em>Job</em> i: 11.</p>

<p class='c007'>While in Job the two great tendencies are characterized
simply as good and bad, the problem in Faust is a
pronouncedly erotic one; viz., the battle between sublimation
and eros, in which the Devil is strikingly characterized
through the fitting rôle of the erotic tempter. The
erotic is lacking in Job; at the same time Job is not conscious
of the conflict within his own soul; he even continuously
disputes the arguments of his friends who wish
to convince him of evil in his own heart. To this extent,
one might say that Faust is considerably more honorable
since he openly confesses to the torments of his
soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller acts like Job; she says nothing, and lets
the evil and the good come from the other world, from
the metapsychologic. Therefore, the identification with
Job is also significant in this respect. A wider, and, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>a very important analogy remains to be mentioned.
The creative power, which love really is, rightly considered
from the natural standpoint, remains as the real
attribute of the Divinity, sublimated from the erotic impression;
therefore, in the poem God is praised throughout
as Creator.</p>

<p class='c007'>Job offers the same illustration. Satan is the destroyer
of Job’s fruitfulness. God is the fruitful one himself,
therefore, at the end of the book, he gives forth, as an
expression of his own creative power, this hymn, filled
with lofty poetic beauty. In this hymn, strangely enough,
two unsympathetic representatives of the animal kingdom,
behemoth and the leviathan, both expressive of the
crudest force conceivable in nature, are given chief consideration;
the behemoth being really the phallic attribute
of the God of Creation.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Behold now behemoth, which I made as well as thee;</div>
      <div class='line'>He eateth grass as an ox.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lo, now; his strength is in his loins,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his force is in the muscles of his belly.</div>
      <div class='line'>He moveth his tail like a cedar:</div>
      <div class='line'>The sinews of his thighs are knit together.</div>
      <div class='line'>His bones are as tubes of brass;</div>
      <div class='line'>His limbs are like bars of iron.</div>
      <div class='line'>He is the chief of the ways of God:</div>
      <div class='line'>He only that made him giveth him his sword....</div>
      <div class='line'>Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not;</div>
      <div class='line'>He is confident though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall any take him when he is on the watch.</div>
      <div class='line'>Or pierce through his nose with a snare?</div>
      <div class='line'>Canst thou draw leviathan with a fish-hook?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or press down his tongue with a cord?...</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Lay thy hand upon him;</div>
      <div class='line'>Remember the battle and do no more.</div>
      <div class='line'>None is so fierce that dare stir him up:</div>
      <div class='line'>Who then is he that can stand before me?</div>
      <div class='line'>Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him?</div>
      <div class='line'>Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.”</div>
      <div class='line in18'>—<em>Job</em> xl: 15–20, 23–24; xli: 1, 8, 10–11.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>God says this in order to bring his power and omnipotence
impressively before Job’s eyes. God is like the
behemoth and the leviathan; the fruitful nature giving
forth abundance,—the untamable wildness and boundlessness
of nature,—and the overwhelming danger of the
unchained power.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c008'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But what has destroyed Job’s earthly paradise? The
unchained power of nature. As the poet lets it be seen
here, God has simply turned his other side outwards for
once; the side which man calls the devil, and which lets
loose all the torments of nature on Job, naturally for the
purpose of discipline and training. The God who created
such monstrosities, before whom the poor weak man
stiffens with anxiety, truly must hide qualities within himself
which are food for thought. This God lives in the
heart, in the unconscious, in the realm of metapsychology.
There is the source of the anxiety before the unspeakably
horrible, and of the strength to withstand the horrors.
The person, that is to say his conscious “I,” is like a plaything,
like a feather which is whirled around by different
currents of air; sometimes the sacrifice and sometimes the
sacrificer, and he cannot hinder either. The Book of Job
shows us God at work both as creator and destroyer.
Who is this God? A thought which humanity in every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>part of the world and in all ages has brought forth from
itself and always again anew in similar forms; a power in
the other world to which man gives praise, a power which
creates as well as destroys, an idea necessary to life.
Since, psychologically understood, the divinity is nothing
else than a projected complex of representation which is
accentuated in feeling according to the degree of religiousness
of the individual, so God is to be considered as the
representative of a certain sum of energy (libido).
This energy, therefore, appears projected (metaphysically)
because it works from the unconscious outwards,
when it is dislodged from there, as psychoanalysis shows.
As I have earlier made apparent in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bedeutung des
Vaters</span>,” the religious instinct feeds upon the incestuous
libido of the infantile period. In the principal forms
of religion which now exist, the father transference seems
to be at least the moulding influence; in older religions,
it seems to be the influence of the mother transference
which creates the attributes of the divinity. The attributes
of the divinity are omnipotence, a sternly persecuting
paternalism ruling through fear (Old Testament)
and a loving paternalism (New Testament). These are
the attributes of the libido in that wide sense in which
Freud has conceived this idea empirically. In certain
pagan and also in certain Christian attributes of divinity
the maternal stands out strongly, and in the former the
animal also comes into the greatest prominence.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c008'><sup>[81]</sup></a> Likewise,
the infantile, so closely interwoven with religious
phantasies, and from time to time breaking forth so violently,
is nowhere lacking.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c008'><sup>[82]</sup></a> All this points to the sources
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of the dynamic states of religious activity. These are
those impulses which in childhood are withdrawn from
incestuous application through the intervention of the
incest barrier and which, especially at the time of puberty,
as a result of affluxes of libido coming from the still incompletely
employed sexuality, are aroused to their own
peculiar activity. As is easily understood, that which is
valuable in the God-creating idea is not the form but
the power, the libido. The primitive power which Job’s
Hymn of Creation vindicates, the unconditional and inexorable,
the unjust and the superhuman, are truly and
rightly attributes of libido, which “lead us unto life,”
which “let the poor be guilty,” and against which struggle
is in vain. Nothing remains for mankind but to work
in harmony with this will. Nietzsche’s “Zarathustra”
teaches us this impressively.</p>

<p class='c007'>We see that in Miss Miller the religious hymn arising
from the unconscious is the compensating amend for the
erotic; it takes a great part of its materials from the
infantile reminiscences which she reawakened into life
by the introversion of the libido. Had this religious creation
not succeeded (and also had another sublimated
application been eliminated) then Miss Miller would
have yielded to the erotic impression, either to its natural
consequence or to a negative issue, which would have
replaced the lost success in love by a correspondingly
strong sorrow. It is well known that opinions are much
divided concerning the worth of this issue of an erotic
conflict, such as Miss Miller has presented to us. It is
thought to be much more beautiful to solve unnoticed an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>erotic tension, in the elevated feelings of religious poetry,
in which perhaps many other people can find joy and
consolation. One is wrong to storm against this conception
from the radical standpoint of fanaticism for
truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think that one should view with philosophic admiration
the strange paths of the libido and should investigate
the purposes of its circuitous ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not too much to say that we have herewith dug up
the erotic root, and yet the problem remains unsolved.
Were there not bound up with that a mysterious purpose,
probably of the greatest biological meaning, then certainly
twenty centuries would not have yearned for it
with such intense longing. Doubtless, this sort of libidian
current moves in the same direction as, taken in the widest
sense, did that ecstatic ideal of the Middle Ages and of
the ancient mystery cults, one of which became the later
Christianity. There is to be seen biologically in this
ideal an exercise of psychologic projection (of the paranoidian
mechanism, as Freud would express it).<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c008'><sup>[83]</sup></a> The
projection consists in the repressing of the conflict into
the unconscious and the setting forth of the repressed
contents into seeming objectivity, which is also the formula
of paranoia. The repression serves, as is well
known, for the freeing from a painful complex from
which one must escape by all means because its compelling
and oppressing power is feared. The repression can lead
to an apparent complete suppression which corresponds
to a strong self-control. Unfortunately, however, self-control
has limits which are only too narrowly drawn.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Closer observation of people shows, it is true, that calm
is maintained at the critical moment, but certain results
occur which fall into two categories.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>First</em>, the suppressed effect comes to the surface immediately
afterwards; seldom directly, it is true, but ordinarily
in the form of a displacement to another object
(e. g. a person is, in official relations, polite, submissive,
patient, and so on, and turns his whole anger loose upon
his wife or his subordinates).</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Second</em>, the suppressed effect creates compensations
elsewhere. For example, people who strive for excessive
ethics, who try always to think, feel, and act altruistically
and ideally, avenge themselves, because of the impossibility
of carrying out their ideals, by subtle maliciousness,
which naturally does not come into their own consciousness
as such, but which leads to misunderstandings and
unhappy situations. Apparently, then, all of these are
only “especially unfortunate circumstances,” or they are
the guilt and malice of other people, or they are tragic
complications.</p>

<p class='c007'>One is, indeed, freed of the conscious conflict, nevertheless
it lies invisible at one’s feet, and is stumbled over
at every step. The technic of the apparent suppressing
and forgetting is inadequate because it is not possible of
achievement in the last analysis—it is in reality a mere
makeshift. The religious projection offers a much more
effectual help. In this one keeps the conflict in sight
(care, pain, anxiety, and so on) and gives it over to a
personality standing outside of one’s self, the Divinity.
The evangelical command teaches us this:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“Cast all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for
you.”—<cite>I Peter</cite> v: 7.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In nothing be anxious; but in every thing by prayer and supplication&nbsp;... let your requests be made known unto God.”—<cite>Phil.</cite>
iv: 6.</p>

<p class='c007'>One must give the burdening complex of the soul consciously
over to the Deity; that is to say, associate it with
a definite representation complex which is set up as objectively
real, as a person who answers those questions,
for us unanswerable. To this inner demand belongs the
candid avowal of sin and the Christian humility presuming
such an avowal. Both are for the purpose of making
it possible for one to examine one’s self and to know one’s
self.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c008'><sup>[84]</sup></a> One may consider the mutual avowal of sins as
the most powerful support to this work of education
(“Confess, therefore, your sins one to another.”—James
v: 16). These measures aim at a conscious recognition
of the conflicts, thoroughly psychoanalytic, which is also
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a conditio sine qua non</span></i> of the psychoanalytic condition
of recovery. Just as psychoanalysis in the hands of the
physician, a secular method, sets up the real object of
transference as the one to take over the conflicts of the
oppressed and to solve them, so the Christian religion sets
up the Saviour, considered as real; “In whom we have
redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
sins....” (Eph. i: 7 and Col. i: 14.)<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c008'><sup>[85]</sup></a> He is the
deliverer and redeemer of our guilt, a God who stands
above sin, “who did no sin, neither was guile found in
his mouth” (Pet. ii: 22). “Who his own self bare our
sins in his body upon the tree” (Pet. ii: 24). “Therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Christ has been sacrificed once to take away the
sins of many” (Heb. ix: 28). The God, thus thought
of, is distinguished as innocent in himself and as the
self-sacrificer. (These qualities are true also for that
amount of energy—libido—which belongs to the representation
complex designated the Redeemer.) The
conscious projection towards which the Christian education
aims, offers, therefore, a double benefit: first, one is
kept conscious of the conflict (sins) of two opposing
tendencies mutually resistant, and through this one prevents
a known trouble from becoming, by means of repressing
and forgetting, an unknown and therefore so
much more tormenting sorrow. Secondly, one lightens
one’s burden by surrendering it to him to whom all solutions
are known. One must not forget that the individual
psychologic roots of the Deity, set up as real by the pious,
are concealed from him, and that he, although unaware
of this, still bears the burden alone and is still alone with
his conflict. This delusion would lead infallibly to the
speedy breaking up of the system, for Nature cannot indefinitely
be deceived, but the powerful institution of
Christianity meets this situation. The command in the
book of James is the best expression of the psychologic
significance of this: “Bear ye one another’s burdens.”<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c008'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This is emphasized as especially important in order
to preserve society upright through mutual love (Transference);
the Pauline writings leave no doubt about this:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Through love be servants one to another.”—<em>Gal.</em> v: 13.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Let love of the brethren continue.”—<em>Heb.</em> xiii: 1.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>good works. Not forgetting our own assembling together as
is the custom of some, but exhorting one another.”—<em>Heb.</em> x: 24–25.</p>

<p class='c007'>We might say that the real transference taught in the
Christian community is the condition absolutely necessary
for the efficacy of the miracle of redemption; the first
letter of John comes out frankly with this:</p>

<p class='c017'>“He that loveth his brother abideth in the light.”—<cite>I John</cite>
ii: 10.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If we love one another, God abideth in us.”—<cite>I John</cite> iv: 12.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Deity continues to be efficacious in the Christian
religion only upon the foundation of brotherly love.
Consequently, here too the mystery of redemption is the
unresisting real transference.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c008'><sup>[87]</sup></a> One may properly ask
one’s self, for what then is the Deity useful, if his efficacy
consists only in the <em>real transference</em>? To this also the
evangelical message has a striking answer:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Men are all brothers in Christ.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“So Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins
of many, shall appear a second time apart from sin to them
that wait for him unto salvation.”—<em>Heb.</em> ix: 28.</p>

<p class='c007'>The condition of transference among brothers is to be
such as between man and Christ, a spiritual one. As the
history of ancient cults and certain Christian sects shows,
this explanation of the Christian religion is an especially
important one biologically, for the psychologic intimacy
creates certain shortened ways between men which lead
only too easily to that from which Christianity seeks to
release them, namely to the sexual relation with all those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>consequences and necessities under which the really already
highly civilized man had to suffer at the beginning
of our Christian era. For just as the ancient religious
experience was regarded distinctly as a bodily union with
the Deity,<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c008'><sup>[88]</sup></a> just so was worship permeated with sexuality
of every kind. Sexuality lay only too close to the
relations of people with each other. The moral degeneracy
of the first Christian century produced a moral reaction
arising out of the darkness of the lowest strata of
society which was expressed in the second and third centuries
at its purest in the two antagonistic religions, Christianity
on the one side, and Mithracism on the other.
These religions strove after precisely that higher form
of social intercourse symbolic of a projected “become
flesh” idea (logos), whereby all those strongest impulsive
energies of the archaic man, formerly plunging him
from one passion into another,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c008'><sup>[89]</sup></a> and which seemed to the
ancients like the compulsion of the evil constellations, as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἱμαρμένη</span>,<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c008'><sup>[90]</sup></a> and which in the sense of later ages might
be translated as the driving force of the libido,<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c008'><sup>[91]</sup></a> the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δύναμις κινητική</span><a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c008'><sup>[92]</sup></a> of Zeno, could be made use of for
social preservation.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c008'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It may be assumed most certainly that the domestication
of humanity has cost the greatest sacrifices. An age
which produced the stoical ideal must certainly have
known why and against what it was created. The age
of Nero serves to set off effectually the famous extracts
from the forty-first letter of Seneca to Lucilius:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“One drags the other into error, and how can we attain to
salvation when no one bids us halt, when all the world drives
us in deeper?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do you ever come across a man unafraid in danger, untouched
by desires, happy in misfortune, peaceful in the midst
of a storm, elevated above ordinary mortals, on the same plane
as the gods, does not reverence seize you? Are you not compelled
to say, ‘Such an exalted being is certainly something different
from the miserable body which he inhabits?’ A divine strength
rules there, such an excellent mind, full of moderation, raised above
all trivialities, which smiles at that which we others fear or strive
after: a heavenly power animates such a person, a thing of this
kind does not exist without the coöperation of a deity. The
largest part of such a being belongs to the region from which he
came. Just as the sun’s rays touch the earth in reality and yet
are at home only there from whence they come, so an eminent
holy man associates with us. He is sent to us that we may
learn to know the divine better, and although with us, still really
belongs to his original home. He looks thither and reaches towards
it; among us he walks as an exalted being.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The people of this age had grown ripe for identification
with the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόγος</span> (word) “become flesh,” for the
founding of a new fellowship, united by one idea,<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c008'><sup>[94]</sup></a> in the
name of which people could love each other and call
each other brothers.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c008'><sup>[95]</sup></a> The old vague idea of a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεσίτης</span>
(Messiah), of a mediator in whose name new ways of
love would be created, became a fact, and with that humanity
made an immense step forward. This had not
been brought about by a speculative, completely sophisticated
philosophy, but by an elementary need in the mass of
people vegetating in spiritual darkness. The profoundest
necessities had evidently driven them towards that, since
humanity did not thrive in a state of dissoluteness.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c008'><sup>[96]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>meaning of those cults—I speak of Christianity and
Mithracism—is clear; it is a moral restraint of animal
impulses.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c008'><sup>[97]</sup></a> The dynamic appearance of both religions
betrays something of that enormous feeling of redemption
which animated the first disciples and which we to-day
scarcely know how to appreciate, for these old truths
are empty to us. Most certainly we should still understand
it, had our customs even a breath of ancient brutality,
for we can hardly realize in this day the whirlwinds
of the unchained libido which roared through the ancient
Rome of the Cæsars. The civilized man of the present
day seems very far removed from that. He has become
merely neurotic. So for us the necessities which brought
forth Christianity have actually been lost, since we no
longer understand their meaning. We do not know
against what it had to protect us.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c008'><sup>[98]</sup></a> For enlightened people,
the so-called religiousness has already approached
very close to a neurosis. In the past two thousand years
Christianity has done its work and has erected barriers
of repression, which protect us from the sight of our
own “sinfulness.” The elementary emotions of the
libido have come to be unknown to us, for they are carried
on in the unconscious; therefore, the belief which
combats them has become hollow and empty. Let whoever
does not believe that a mask covers our religion, obtain
an impression for himself from the appearance of
our modern churches, from which style and art have long
since fled.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this we turn back to the question from which we
digressed, namely, whether or not Miss Miller has created
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>something valuable with her poem. If we bear in
mind under what psychologic or moral conditions Christianity
came into existence; that is to say, at a time when
fierce brutality was an every-day spectacle, then we understand
the religious seizure of the whole personality and
the worth of that religion which defended the people of
the Roman culture against the visible storms of wickedness.
It was not difficult for those people to remain conscious
of sin, for they saw it every day spread out before
their eyes. The religious product was at that time the
accomplishment of the total personality. Miss Miller not
only undervalues her “sins,” but the connection between
the “depressing and unrelenting need” and her religious
product has even escaped her. Thus her poetical creation
completely loses the living value of a religious
product. It is not much more than a sentimental transformation
of the erotic which is secretly carried out close
to consciousness and principally possesses the same worth
as the manifest content of the dream<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c008'><sup>[99]</sup></a> with its uncertain
and delusive perishableness. Thus the poem is properly
only a dream become audible.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the degree that the modern consciousness is eagerly
busied with things of a wholly other sort than religion,
religion and its object, original sin, have stepped into the
background; that is to say, into the unconscious in great
part. Therefore, to-day man believes neither in the one
nor in the other. Consequently the Freudian school is accused
of an impure phantasy, and yet one might convince
one’s self very easily with a rather fleeting glance at the
history of ancient religions and morals as to what kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>of demons are harbored in the human soul. With this
disbelief in the crudeness of human nature is bound up
the disbelief in the power of religion. The phenomenon,
well known to every psychoanalyst, of the unconscious
transformation of an erotic conflict into religious activity
is something <em>ethically wholly worthless</em> and nothing but
an hysterical production. Whoever, on the other hand,
to his conscious sin just as consciously places religion in
opposition, does something the greatness of which cannot
be denied. This can be verified by a backward glance
over history. Such a procedure is sound religion. <em>The
unconscious recasting of the erotic into something religious
lays itself open to the reproach of a sentimental
and ethically worthless pose.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>By means of the secular practice of the naïve projection
which is, as we have seen, nothing else than a veiled or
indirect real-transference (through the spiritual, through
the logos), Christian training has produced a widespread
weakening of the animal nature so that a great part of
the strength of the impulses could be set free for the
work of social preservation and fruitfulness.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c008'><sup>[100]</sup></a> This
abundance of libido, to make use of this singular expression,
pursues with a budding renaissance (for example
Petrarch) a course which outgoing antiquity had
already sketched out as religious; viz., the way of the
transference to nature.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c008'><sup>[101]</sup></a> The transformation of this
libidinous interest is in great part due to the Mithraic
worship, which was a nature religion in the best sense of
the word;<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c008'><sup>[102]</sup></a> while the primitive Christians exhibited
throughout an antagonistic attitude to the beauties of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>world.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c008'><sup>[103]</sup></a> I remember the passage of St. Augustine mentioned
by J. Burckhardt:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Men draw thither to admire the heights of the mountains
and the powerful waves of the sea—and to turn away from
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The foremost authority on the Mithraic cult, Franz
Cumont,<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c008'><sup>[104]</sup></a> says as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The gods were everywhere and mingled in all the events of
daily life. The fire which cooked the means of nourishment for
the believers and which warmed them; the water which quenched
their thirst and cleansed them; also the air which they breathed,
and the day which shone for them, were the objects of their
homage. Perhaps no religion has given to its adherents in so
large a degree as Mithracism opportunity for prayer and motive
for devotion. When the initiated betook himself in the evening
to the sacred grotto concealed in the solitude of the forest, at
every step new sensations awakened in his heart some mystical
emotion. The stars that shone in the sky, the wind that whispered
in the foliage, the spring or brook which hastened murmuring to
the valley, even the earth which he trod under his feet, were in
his eyes divine; and all surrounding nature a worshipful fear of
the infinite forces that swayed the universe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These fundamental thoughts of Mithracism, which,
like so much else of the ancient spiritual life, arose again
from their grave during the renaissance are to be found
in the beautiful words of Seneca:<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c008'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“When you enter a grove peopled with ancient trees, higher
than the ordinary, and whose boughs are so closely interwoven
that the sky cannot be seen, the stately shadows of the wood, the
privacy of the place, and the awful gloom cannot but strike you,
as with the presence of a deity, or when we see some cave at
the foot of a mountain penetrating the rocks, not made by human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>hands, but hollowed out to great depths by nature; it fills the
mind with a religious fear; we venerate the fountain-heads of
great rivers; the sudden eruption of a vast body of water from
the secret places of the earth, obtains an altar: we adore likewise
the springs of warm baths, and either the opaque quality or
immense depths, hath made some lakes sacred.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All this disappeared in the transitory world of the
Christian, only to break forth much later when the
thought of mankind had achieved that <em>independence of
the idea</em> which could resist the æsthetic impression, so that
thought was no longer fettered by the emotional effects
of the impression, but could rise to reflective observation.
Thus man entered into a new and independent relation to
nature whereby the foundation was laid for natural science
and technique. With that, however, there entered in for
the first time a displacement of the weight of interest;
there arose again real-transference which has reached its
greatest development in our time. Materialistic interest
has everywhere become paramount. Therefore, the
realms of the spirit, where earlier the greatest conflicts
and developments took place, lie deserted and fallow; the
world has not only lost its God as the sentimentalists of
the nineteenth century bewail, but also to some extent has
lost its soul as well. One, therefore, cannot wonder that
the discoveries and doctrines of the Freudian school, with
their wholly psychologic views, meet with an almost universal
disapproval. Through the change of the centre of
interest from the inner to the outer world, the knowledge
of nature has increased enormously in comparison with
that of earlier times. By this the anthropomorphic conception
of the religious dogmas has been definitely thrown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>open to question; therefore, the present-day religions
can only with the greatest difficulty close their eyes to this
fact; for not only has the intense interest been diverted
from the Christian religion, but criticism and the necessary
correction have increased correspondingly. The
Christian religion seems to have fulfilled its great biological
purpose, in so far as we are able to judge. It has
led human thought to independence, and has lost its significance,
therefore, to a yet undetermined extent; in any
case its dogmatic contents have become related to Mithracism.
In consideration of the fact that this religion
has rendered, nevertheless, inconceivable service to education,
one cannot reject it “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo ipso</span>” to-day. It seems
to me that we might still make use in some way of its
form of thought, and especially of its great wisdom of
life, which for two thousand years has been proven to
be particularly efficacious. The stumbling block is the
<em>unhappy combination of religion and morality</em>. That
must be overcome. There still remain traces of this strife
in the soul, the lack of which in a human being is reluctantly
felt. It is hard to say in what such things consist;
for this, ideas as well as words are lacking. If, in
spite of that, I attempt to say something about it, I do
it parabolically, using Seneca’s words:<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c008'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“Nothing can be more commendable and beneficial if you persevere
in the pursuit of wisdom. It is what would be ridiculous
to wish for when it is in your power to attain it. There is no
need to lift up your hands to Heaven, or to pray the servant of
the temple to admit you to the ear of the idol that your prayers
may be heard the better. God is near thee; he is with thee.
Yes, Lucilius, a holy spirit resides within us, the observer of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>good and evil, and our constant guardian. And as we treat
him, he treats us; no good man is without a God. Could any one
ever rise above the power of fortune without his assistance? It
is he that inspires us with thoughts, upright, just and pure. We
do not, indeed, pretend to say what God; but that a God dwells
in the breast of every good man is certain.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE SONG OF THE MOTH</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A little later Miss Miller travelled from Geneva to
Paris. She says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“My weariness on the railway was so great that I could
hardly sleep an hour. It was terrifically hot in the ladies’
carriage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At four o’clock in the morning she noticed a moth that
flew against the light in her compartment. She then tried
to go to sleep again. Suddenly the following poem took
possession of her mind.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'><em>The Moth to the Sun</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I longed for thee when first I crawled to consciousness.</div>
      <div class='line'>My dreams were all of thee when in the chrysalis I lay.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft myriads of my kind beat out their lives</div>
      <div class='line'>Against some feeble spark once caught from thee.</div>
      <div class='line'>And one hour more—and my poor life is gone;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet my last effort, as my first desire, shall be</div>
      <div class='line'>But to approach thy glory; then, having gained</div>
      <div class='line'>One raptured glance, I’ll die content.</div>
      <div class='line'>For I, the source of beauty, warmth and life</div>
      <div class='line'>Have in his perfect splendor once beheld.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Before we go into the material which Miss Miller
offers us for the understanding of the poem, we will
again cast a glance over the psychologic situation in which
the poem originated. Some months or weeks appear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>have elapsed since the last direct manifestation of the
unconscious that Miss Miller reported to us; about this
period we have had no information. We learn nothing
about the moods and phantasies of this time. If one
might draw a conclusion from this silence it would be
presumably that in the time which elapsed between the
two poems, really nothing of importance had happened,
and that, therefore, this poem is again but a voiced fragment
of the unconscious working of the complex stretching
out over months and years. It is highly probable that
it is concerned with the same complex as before.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c008'><sup>[107]</sup></a> The
earlier product, a hymn of creation full of hope, has,
however, but little similarity to the present poem. The
poem lying before us has a truly hopeless, melancholy
character; moth and sun, two things which never meet.
One must in fairness ask, is a moth really expected to
rise to the sun? We know indeed the proverbial saying
about the moth that flew into the light and singed its
wings, but not the legend of the moth that strove towards
the sun. Plainly, here, two things are connected in her
thoughts that do not belong together; first, the moth
which fluttered around the light so long that it burnt
itself; and then, the idea of a small ephemeral being,
something like the day fly, which, in lamentable contrast
to the eternity of the stars, longs for an imperishable
daylight. This idea reminds one of Faust:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight’s glow</div>
      <div class='line'>The green-embosomed houses glitter;</div>
      <div class='line'>The glow retreats, done is the day of toil,</div>
      <div class='line'>It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!</div>
      <div class='line'>Then would I see eternal Evening gild</div>
      <div class='line'>The silent world beneath me glowing....</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking;</div>
      <div class='line'>The new-born impulse fires my mind,—</div>
      <div class='line'>I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking,</div>
      <div class='line'>The day before me and the night behind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,—</div>
      <div class='line'>A glorious dream! though now the glories fade.</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid</div>
      <div class='line'>Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Not long afterwards, Faust sees “the black dog roving
there through cornfields and stubble,” the dog who is the
same as the devil, the tempter, in whose hellish fires
Faust has singed his wings. When he believed that he
was expressing his great longing for the beauty of the

<p class='c007'>This is what Faust had said shortly before, in true
recognition of the state of affairs. The honoring of the
beauty of nature led the Christian of the Middle Ages to
pagan thoughts which lay in an antagonistic relation to
his conscious religion, just as once Mithracism was in
threatening competition with Christianity, for Satan often
disguises himself as an angel of light.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c008'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The longing of Faust became his ruin. The longing
for the Beyond had brought as a consequence a loathing
for life, and he stood on the brink of self-destruction.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c008'><sup>[109]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The longing for the beauty of this world led him anew
to ruin, into doubt and pain, even to Marguerite’s tragic
death. His mistake was that he followed after both
worlds with no check to the driving force of his libido,
like a man of violent passion. Faust portrays once more
the folk-psychologic conflict of the beginning of the
Christian era, but what is noteworthy, in a reversed
order.</p>

<p class='c007'>Against what fearful powers of seduction Christ had
to defend himself by means of his hope of the absolute
world beyond, may be seen in the example of Alypius in
Augustine. If any of us had been living in that period
of antiquity, he would have seen clearly that that culture
must inevitably collapse because humanity revolted
against it. It is well known that even before the spread
of Christianity a remarkable expectation of redemption
had taken possession of mankind. The following
eclogue of Virgil might well be a result of this mood:</p>

<p class='c007'>The turning to asceticism resulting from the general
expansion of Christianity brought about a new misfortune
to many: monasticism and the life of the anchorite.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c008'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Faust takes the reverse course; for him the ascetic
ideal means death. He struggles for freedom and wins
life, at the same time giving himself over to the Evil One;
but through this he becomes the bringer of death to her
whom he loves most, Marguerite. He tears himself
away from pain and sacrifices his life in unceasing useful
work, through which he saves many lives.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c008'><sup>[114]</sup></a> His double
mission as saviour and destroyer has already been hinted
in a preliminary manner:</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>A parallel to this double rôle is that text in the Gospel
of Matthew which has become historically significant:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I came not to send peace, but a sword.”—<cite>Matt.</cite> x: 34.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just this constitutes the deep significance of Goethe’s
Faust, that he clothes in words a problem of modern
man which has been turning in restless slumber since the
Renaissance, just as was done by the drama of Oedipus
for the Hellenic sphere of culture. What is to be the way
out between the Scylla of renunciation of the world and
the Charybdis of the acceptance of the world?</p>

<p class='c007'>The hopeful tone, voiced in the “Hymn to the God
of Creation,” cannot continue very long with our author.
The pose simply promises, but does not fulfil. The old
longing will come again, for it is a peculiarity of all complexes
worked over merely in the unconscious<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c008'><sup>[115]</sup></a> that they
lose nothing of their original amount of affect. Meanwhile,
their outward manifestations can change almost
endlessly. One might therefore consider the first poem
as an unconscious longing to solve the conflict through
positive religiousness, somewhat in the same manner as
they of the earlier centuries decided their conscious conflicts
by opposing to them the religious standpoint. This
wish does not succeed. Now with the second poem there
follows a second attempt which turns out in a decidedly
more material way; its thought is unequivocal. Only
once “having gained one raptured glance&nbsp;...” and
then—to die.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the realms of the religious world, the attention,
just as in Faust,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c008'><sup>[116]</sup></a> turns towards the sun of this world,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and already there is something mingled with it which
has another sense, that is to say, <em>the moth which fluttered
so long around the light that it burnt its wings</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now pass to that which Miss Miller offers for the
better understanding of the poem. She says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“This small poem made a profound impression upon me. I
could not, of course, find immediately a sufficiently clear and direct
explanation for it. However, a few days later when I once
more read a certain philosophical work, which I had read in
Berlin the previous winter, and which I had enjoyed very much,
(I was reading it aloud to a friend), I came across the following
words: ‘La même aspiration passionnée de la mite vers l’étoile,
de l’homme vers Dieu.’ (The same passionate longing of the
moth for the star, of man for God.) I had forgotten this sentence
entirely, but it seemed very clear to me that precisely these words
had reappeared in my hypnagogic poem. In addition to that it
occurred to me that a play seen some years previously, ‘La Mite
et La Flamme,’ was a further possible cause of the poem. It is
easy to see how often the word ‘moth’ had been impressed upon
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The deep impression made by the poem upon the
author shows that she put into it a large amount of love.
In the expression “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aspiration passionnée</span>” we meet the
passionate longing of the moth for the star, of man for
God, and indeed, the moth is Miss Miller herself. Her
last observation that the word “moth” was often impressed
upon her shows how often she had noticed the
word “moth” as applicable to herself. <em>Her longing for
God resembles the longing of the moth for the “star.”</em>
The reader will recall that this expression has already had
a place in the earlier material, “when the morning stars
sang together,” that is to say, the ship’s officer who sings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>on deck in the night watch. The passionate longing for
God is the same as that longing for the singing morning
stars. It was pointed out at great length in the foregoing
chapter that this analogy is to be expected: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic
parvis componere magna solebam.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is shameful or exalted just as one chooses, that the
divine longing of humanity, which is really the first thing
to make it human, should be brought into connection with
an erotic phantasy. Such a comparison jars upon the finer
feelings. Therefore, one is inclined in spite of the undeniable
facts to dispute the connection. An Italian
steersman with brown hair and black moustache, and the
loftiest, dearest conception of humanity! These two
things cannot be brought together; against this not only
our religious feelings revolt, but our taste also rebels.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would certainly be unjust to make a comparison of
the two objects as concrete things since they are so heterogeneous.
One loves a Beethoven sonata but one loves
caviar also. It would not occur to any one to liken the
sonata to caviar. It is a common error for one to judge
the longing according to the quality of the object. The
appetite of the gourmand which is only satisfied with
goose liver and quail is no more distinguished than the
appetite of the laboring man for corned beef and cabbage.
The longing is the same; the object changes. Nature is
beautiful only by virtue of the longing and love given
her by man. The æsthetic attributes emanating from
that has influence primarily on the libido, which alone
constitutes the beauty of nature. The dream recognizes
this well when it depicts a strong and beautiful feeling by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>means of a representation of a beautiful landscape.
Whenever one moves in the territory of the erotic it
becomes altogether clear how little the object and how
much the love means. The “sexual object” is as a rule
overrated far too much and that only on account of the
extreme degree to which libido is devoted to the object.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apparently Miss Miller had but little left over for
the officer, which is humanly very intelligible. But in
spite of that a deep and lasting effect emanates from
this connection which places divinity on a par with the
erotic object. The moods which apparently are produced
by these objects do not, however, spring from them, but
are manifestations of her strong love. When Miss
Miller praises either God or the sun she means her love,
that deepest and strongest impulse of the human and
animal being.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader will recall that in the preceding chapter the
following chain of synonyms was adduced: the singer—God
of sound—singing morning star—creator—God of
Light—sun—fire—God of Love.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that time we had placed sun and fire in parentheses.
Now they are entitled to their right place in the chain of
synonyms. With the changing of the erotic impression
from the affirmative to the negative the symbols of light
occur as the paramount object. In the second poem where
the longing is clearly exposed it is by no means the terrestrial
sun. Since the longing has been turned away from
the real object, its object has become, first of all, a subjective
one, namely, God. Psychologically, however, God
is the name of a representation-complex which is grouped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>around a strong feeling (the sum of libido). Properly,
the feeling is what gives character and reality to the complex.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c008'><sup>[117]</sup></a>
<em>The attributes and symbols of the divinity must
belong in a consistent manner to the feeling</em> (<em>longing, love,
libido, and so on</em>). If one honors God, the sun or the
fire, then one honors one’s own vital force, the libido.
It is as Seneca says: “God is near you, he is with you, in
you.” God is our own longing to which we pay divine
honors.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c008'><sup>[118]</sup></a> If it were not known how tremendously significant
religion was, and is, this marvellous play with
one’s self would appear absurd. There must be something
more than this, however, because, notwithstanding its
absurdity, it is, in a certain sense, conformable to the
purpose in the highest degree. To bear a God within
one’s self signifies a great deal; it is a guarantee of happiness,
of power, indeed even of omnipotence, as far as
these attributes belong to the Deity. To bear a God
within one’s self signifies just as much as to be God one’s
self. In Christianity, where, it is true, the grossly sensual
representations and symbols are weeded out as carefully
as possible, which seems to be a continuation of the poverty
of symbols of the Jewish cult, there are to be found
plain traces of this psychology. There are even plainer
traces, to be sure, in the “becoming-one with God” in
those mysteries closely related to the Christian, where the
mystic himself is lifted up to divine adoration through
initiatory rites. At the close of the consecration into the
Isis mysteries the mystic was crowned with the palm
crown,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c008'><sup>[119]</sup></a> he was placed on a pedestal and worshipped as
Helios.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c008'><sup>[120]</sup></a> In the magic papyrus of the Mithraic liturgy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>published by Dieterich there is the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερός λόγος</span><a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c008'><sup>[121]</sup></a> of the
consecrated one:</p>

<p class='c017'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐγώ εἰμι σύμπλανος ὑμῖν ἀστὴρ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ βάθους
ἀναλάμπων.</span><a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c008'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The mystic in religious ecstasies put himself on a plane
with the stars, just as a saint of the Middle Ages put
himself by means of the stigmata on a level with Christ.
St. Francis of Assisi expressed this in a truly pagan manner,<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c008'><sup>[123]</sup></a>
even as far as a close relationship with the brother
sun and the sister moon. These representations of “becoming-one
with God” are very ancient. The old belief
removed the becoming-one with God until the time after
death; the mysteries, however, suggest this as taking
place already in this world. A very old text brings most
beautifully before one this unity with God; it is the song
of triumph of the ascending soul.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c008'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The identification with God necessarily has as a result
the enhancing of the meaning and power of the individual.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c008'><sup>[127]</sup></a>
That seems, first of all, to have been really its
purpose: a strengthening of the individual against his
all too great weakness and insecurity in real life. This
great megalomania thus has a genuinely pitiable background.
The strengthening of the consciousness of
power is, however, only an external result of the “becoming-one
with God.” Of much more significance are the
deeper-lying disturbances in the realm of feeling. <em>Whoever
introverts libido—that is to say, whoever takes it
away from a real object without putting in its place a real
compensation—is overtaken by the inevitable results of
introversion.</em> The libido, which is turned inward into the
subject, awakens again from among the sleeping remembrances
one which contains the path upon which earlier
the libido once had come to the real object. At the
very first and in foremost position it was father and
mother who were the objects of the childish love. They
are unequalled and imperishable. Not many difficulties
are needed in an adult’s life to cause those memories to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>reawaken and to become effectual. <em>In religion the regressive
reanimation of the father-and-mother imago is
organized into a system.</em> The benefits of religion are the
benefits of parental hands; its protection and its peace
are the results of parental care upon the child; its mystic
feelings are the unconscious memories of the tender
emotions of the first childhood, just as the hymn expresses
it:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am in my country, I come into my city. Daily am I together
with my father Atum.”<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c008'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The visible father of the world is, however, the sun,
the heavenly fire; therefore, Father, God, Sun, Fire are
mythologically synonymous. The well-known fact that
in the sun’s strength the great generative power of nature
is honored shows plainly, very plainly, to any one to whom
as yet it may not be clear that in the Deity man honors
his own libido, and naturally in the form of the image or
symbol of the present object of transference. This
symbol faces us in an especially marked manner in the
third Logos of the Dieterich papyrus. After the second
prayer<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c008'><sup>[129]</sup></a> stars come from the disc of the sun to the mystic,
“five-pointed, in quantities, filling the whole air. If the
sun’s disc has expanded, you will see an immeasurable
circle, and fiery gates which are shut off.” The mystic
utters the following prayer:</p>

<p class='c017'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐπακουσόν μου, ἀκουσόν μου—ὁ συνδήσας πνεύματι
τὰ πύρινα κλεῖθρα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, δισώματος πυρίπολε,
φωτὸς κτίστα—πυρίπνοε, πυρίθυμε, πνευματόφως, πυριχαρῆ,
καλλίφως, φωτοκράτωρ, πυρισώματε, φωτοδότα,
πυρισπόρε, πυρικλόνε, φωτόβιε, πυριδῖνα, φωτοκινῆτα</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεραυνοκλόνε, φωτὸς κλέος, αὐξησίφως, ἐνπυρισχησίφως,
ἀστροδάμα.</span><a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c008'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The invocation is, as one sees, almost inexhaustible in
light and fire attributes, and can be likened in its extravagance
only to the synonymous attributes of love of the
mystic of the Middle Ages. Among the innumerable
texts which might be used as an illustration of this, I
select a passage from the writings of Mechthild von
Magdeburg (1212–1277):</p>

<p class='c017'>“O Lord, love me excessively and love me often and long;
the oftener you love me, so much the purer do I become; the
more excessively you love me, the more beautiful I become;
the longer you love me, the more holy will I become here upon
earth.”</p>

<p class='c017'>God answered: “That I love you often, that I have from my
nature, for I myself am love. That I love you excessively, that
I have from my desire, for I too desire that men love me excessively.
That I love you long, that I have from my everlastingness,
for I am without end.”<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c008'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The religious regression makes use indeed of the
parent image without, however, consciously making it an
object of transference, for the incest horror<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c008'><sup>[132]</sup></a> forbids
that. It remains rather as a synonym, for example, of the
father or of God, or of the more or less personified
symbol of the sun and fire.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c008'><sup>[133]</sup></a> Sun and fire—that is to say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the fructifying strength and heat—are attributes of the
libido. In Mysticism the inwardly perceived, divine
vision is often merely sun or light, and is very little, or
not at all, personified. In the Mithraic liturgy there is
found, for example, a significant quotation:</p>

<p class='c017'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἡ δὲ πορεία τῶν ὁρωμένων θεῶν διὰ τοῦ δίσκου, πατρός
μου, θεοῦ φανήσεται.</span><a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c008'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Hildegarde von Bingen (1100–1178) expresses herself
in the following manner:<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c008'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“But the light I see is not local, but far off, and brighter than
the cloud which supports the sun. I can in no way know the
form of this light since I cannot entirely see the sun’s disc. But
within this light I see at times, and infrequently, another light
which is called by me the living light, but when and in what
manner I see this I do not know how to say, and when I see it
all weariness and need is lifted from me, then too, I feel like a
simple girl and not like an old woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Symeon, the New Theologian (970–1040), says the
following:</p>

<p class='c017'>“My tongue lacks words, and what happens in me my spirit
sees clearly but does not explain. It sees the invisible, that
emptiness of all forms, simple throughout, not complex, and in
extent infinite. For it sees no beginning, and it sees no end. It
is entirely unconscious of the meanings, and does not know what
to call that which it sees. Something complete appears, it seems
to me, not indeed through the being itself, but through a participation.
For you enkindle fire from fire, and you receive the whole
fire; but this remains undiminished and undivided, as before.
Similarly, that which is divided separates itself from the first; and
like something corporeal spreads itself into several lights. This,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>however, is something spiritual, immeasurable, indivisible, and inexhaustible.
For it is not separated when it becomes many, but
remains undivided and is in me, and enters within my poor heart
like a sun or circular disc of the sun, similar to the light,
for it is a light.”<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c008'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>That that thing, perceived as inner light, as the sun of
the other world, is longing, is clearly shown by Symeon’s
words:<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c008'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“And following It my spirit demanded to embrace the splendor
beheld, but it found It not as creature and did not succeed in
coming out from among created beings, so that it might embrace
that uncreated and uncomprehended splendor. Nevertheless it
wandered everywhere, and strove to behold It. <em>It penetrated the
air, it wandered over the Heavens, it crossed over the abysses, it
searched, as it seemed to it, the ends of the world.</em><a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c008'><sup>[138]</sup></a> But in all
of that it found nothing, for all was created. And I lamented
and was sorrowful, and my breast burned, and I lived as one
distraught in mind. But It came, as It would, and descending
like a luminous mystic cloud, It seemed to envelop my whole head so
that dismayed I cried out. But flying away again It left me alone.
And when I, troubled, sought for It, I realized suddenly <em>that It
was in me, myself, and in the midst of my heart It appeared as
the light of a spherical sun</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>It is not astonishing if Nietzsche’s great inner loneliness
calls again into existence certain forms of thought
which the mystic ecstasy of the old cults has elevated to
ritual representation. In the visions of the Mithraic
liturgy we have to deal with many similar representations
which we can now understand without difficulty as the
ecstatic symbol of the libido:</p>

<p class='c017'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μετὰ δὲ τὸ ειπεῖν σε τὸν δεύτερον λόγον, ὅπου σιγὴ
δὶς καὶ τὰ ἀκόλουθα, σύρισον δὶς καὶ πόππυσον δὶς καὶ
εὐθέως ὄψει ἀπὸ τοῦ δίσκου ἀστέρας προσερχομένους πενταδακτυλιαίους
πλείστους καὶ πιπλῶντας ὅλον τὸν αέρα.
Σὺ δὲ πάλιν λέγε: σιγή, σιγή. Καὶ τοῦ δίσκου ἀνοιγέντος

<p class='c007'>Silence is commanded, then the vision of light is revealed.
The similarity of the mystic’s condition and
Nietzsche’s poetical vision is surprising. Nietzsche says
“constellation.” It is well known that constellations are
chiefly therio- or anthropo-morphic symbols.</p>

<p class='c007'>The papyrus says, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀστέρας πενταδακτυλιαίους</span><a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c008'><sup>[141]</sup></a> (similar
to the “rosy-fingered” Eos), which is nothing else
than an anthropomorphic image. Accordingly, one may
expect from that, that by long gazing a living being
would be formed out of the “flame image,” a “star
constellation” of therio- or anthropo-morphic nature, for
the symbolism of the libido does not end with sun, light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and fire, but makes use of wholly other means of expression.
I yield precedence to Nietzsche:</p>

<p class='c007'>Here libido becomes fire, flame and snake. The
Egyptian symbol of the “living disc of the sun,” the disc
with the two entwining snakes, contains the combination
of both the libido analogies. The disc of the sun with
its fructifying warmth is analogous to the fructifying
warmth of love. The comparison of the libido with sun
and fire is in reality analogous.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is also a “causative” element in it, for sun and
fire as beneficent powers are objects of human love; for
example, the sun-hero Mithra is called the “well-beloved.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>In Nietzsche’s poem the comparison is also a
causative one, but this time in a reversed sense. The
comparison with the snake is unequivocally phallic, corresponding
completely with the tendency in antiquity,
which was to see in the symbol of the phallus the quintessence
of life and fruitfulness. <em>The phallus is the source
of life and libido, the great creator and worker of
miracles</em>, and as such it received reverence everywhere.
We have, therefore, three designating symbols of the
libido: First, the <em>comparison by analogy</em>, as sun and
fire. Second, the <em>comparisons based on causative relations</em>,
as A: Object comparison. The libido is designated
by its object, for example, the beneficent sun. B: <em>The subject
comparison</em>, in which the libido is designated by its
place of origin or by analogies of this, for example, by
phallus or (analogous) snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>To these two fundamental forms of comparison still a
third is added, in which the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tertium comparationis</span>” is
<em>the activity</em>; for example, the libido is dangerous when
fecundating like the bull—through the power of its passion—like
the lion, like the raging boar when in heat, like
the ever-rutting ass, and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>This activity comparison can belong equally well to the
category of the analogous or to the category of the causative
comparisons. <em>The possibilities of comparison mean
just as many possibilities for symbolic expression</em>, and
from this basis all the infinitely varied symbols, so far
as they are libido images, may properly be reduced to a
very simple root, that is, just to <em>libido and its fixed
primitive qualities</em>. This psychologic reduction and simplification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>is in accordance with the historic efforts of civilization
to unify and simplify, to syncretize, the endless
number of the gods. We come across this desire as far
back as the old Egyptians, where the unlimited polytheism
as exemplified in the numerous demons of places finally
necessitated simplification. All the various local gods,
Amon of Thebes, Horus of Edfu, Horus of the East,
Chnum of Elephantine, Atum of Heliopolis, and others,<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c008'><sup>[143]</sup></a>
became identified with the sun God Rê. In the hymns to
the sun the composite being Amon-Rê-Harmachis-Atum
was invoked as “the only god which truly lives.”<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c008'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Amenhotep IV (XVIII dynasty) went the furthest
in this direction. He replaced all former gods by the
“living great disc of the sun,” the official title reading:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The sun ruling both horizons, triumphant in the horizon in
his name; the glittering splendor which is in the sun’s disc.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, indeed,” Erman adds,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c008'><sup>[145]</sup></a> “the sun, as a God,
should not be honored, but the sun itself as a planet which
imparts through its rays<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c008'><sup>[146]</sup></a> the infinite life which is in it
to all living creatures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Amenhotep IV by his reform completed a work which
is psychologically important. He united all the bull,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c008'><sup>[147]</sup></a>
ram,<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c008'><sup>[148]</sup></a> crocodile<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c008'><sup>[149]</sup></a> and pile-dwelling<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c008'><sup>[150]</sup></a> gods into the disc
of the sun, and made it clear that their various attributes
were compatible with the sun’s attributes.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c008'><sup>[151]</sup></a> A similar
fate overtook the Hellenic and Roman polytheism
through the syncretistic efforts of later centuries. The
beautiful prayer of Lucius<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c008'><sup>[152]</sup></a> to the queen of the Heavens
furnishes an important proof of this:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“Queen of Heaven, whether thou art the genial Ceres, the
prime parent of fruits;—or whether thou art celestial Venus;—or
whether thou art the sister of Phœbus;—or whether thou art Proserpina,
terrific with midnight howlings—with that feminine
brightness of thine illuminating the walls of every city.”<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c008'><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This attempt to gather again into a few units the religious
thoughts which were divided into countless variations
and personified in individual gods according to
their polytheistic distribution and separation makes clear
the fact that already at an earlier time analogies had
formally arisen. Herodotus is rich in just such references,
not to mention the systems of the Hellenic-Roman
world. Opposed to the endeavor to form a unity there
stands a still stronger endeavor to create again and again
a multiplicity, so that even in the so-called severe monotheistic
religions, as Christianity, for example, the polytheistic
tendency is irrepressible. The Deity is divided into
three parts at least, to which is added the feminine Deity
of Mary and the numerous company of the lesser gods,
the angels and saints, respectively. These two tendencies
are in constant warfare. There is only one God with
countless attributes, or else there are many gods who are
then simply known differently, according to locality, and
personify sometimes this, sometimes that attribute of the
fundamental thought, an example of which we have seen
above in the Egyptian gods.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this we turn once more to Nietzsche’s poem,
“The Beacon.” We found the flame there used as an
image of the libido, theriomorphically represented as a
snake (also as an image of the soul:<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c008'><sup>[154]</sup></a> “This flame is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>mine own soul”). We saw that the snake is to be taken
as a phallic image of the libido (upreared in impatience),
and that this image, also an attribute of the conception of
the sun (the Egyptian sun idol), is an image of the
libido in the combination of sun and phallus. It is not
a wholly strange conception, therefore, that the sun’s
disc is represented with a penis, as well as with hands and
feet. We find proof for this idea in a peculiar part of
the Mithraic liturgy: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ὁ καλούμενος αὐλός,
ἡ ἀρχὴ τοῦ λειτουργοῦντος ἀνέμου. Ὄψει γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ
δίσκου ὡς αὐλὸν κρεμάμενον</span>.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c008'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This extremely important vision of a tube hanging
down from the sun would produce in a religious text, such
as that of the Mithraic liturgy, a strange and at the same
time meaningless effect if it did not have the phallic meaning.
The tube is the place of origin of the wind. The
phallic meaning seems very faint in this idea, but one
must remember that the wind, as well as the sun, is a
fructifier and creator. This has already been pointed out
in a footnote.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c008'><sup>[156]</sup></a> There is a picture by a Germanic painter
of the Middle Ages of the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">conceptio immaculata</span>”
which deserves mention here. The conception is represented
by a tube or pipe coming down from heaven and
passing beneath the skirt of Mary. Into this flies the
Holy Ghost in the form of a dove for the impregnation
of the Mother of God.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c008'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Honegger discovered the following hallucination in an
insane man (paranoid dement): The patient sees in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>sun an “upright tail” similar to an erected penis. When
he moves his head back and forth, then, too, the sun’s
penis sways back and forth in a like manner, and out of
that the wind arises. This strange hallucination remained
unintelligible to us for a long time until I became acquainted
with the Mithraic liturgy and its visions. This
hallucination threw an illuminating light, as it appears to
me, upon a very obscure place in the text which immediately
follows the passage previously cited:</p>

<p class='c017'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰς δὲ τὰ μέρη τὰ πρὸς λίβα ἀπέραντον οἷον ἀπηλιώτην.
Ἐὰν ᾖ κεκληρώμενος εἰς δὲ τὰ μέρη τοῦ ἀπηλιώτου ὁ
ἕτερος, ὁμοίως εἰς τὰ μέρη τὰ ἐκείνου ὄψει τὴν ἀποφορὰν
τοῦ ὁρμάτος.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>Mead translates this very clearly:<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c008'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“And towards the regions westward, as though it were an
infinite Eastwind. But if the other wind, towards the regions
of the East, should be in service, in the like fashion shalt thou
see towards the regions of that side the converse of the sight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the original <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅραμα</span> is the vision, the thing seen.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποφορά</span> means properly the carrying away. The
sense of the text, according to this, might be: the thing
seen may be carried or turned sometimes here, sometimes
there, according to the direction of the wind. The
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅραμα</span> is the tube, “the place of origin of the wind,”
which turns sometimes to the east, sometimes to the west,
and, one might add, generates the corresponding wind.
The vision of the insane man coincides astonishingly with
this description of the movement of the tube.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c008'><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The various attributes of the sun, separated into a
series, appear one after the other in the Mithraic
liturgy. According to the vision of Helios, seven
maidens appear with the heads of snakes, and seven gods
with the heads of black bulls.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is easy to understand the maiden as a symbol of the
libido used in the sense of causative comparison. The
snake in Paradise is usually considered as feminine, as the
seductive principle in woman, and is represented as feminine
by the old artists, although properly the snake has a
phallic meaning. Through a similar change of meaning
the snake in antiquity becomes the symbol of the earth,
which on its side is always considered feminine. The bull
is the well-known symbol for the fruitfulness of the
sun. The bull gods in the Mithraic liturgy were called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κνωθακοφύλακες</span>, “guardians of the axis of the earth,”
by whom the axle of the orb of the heavens was turned.
The divine man, Mithra, also had the same attributes;
he is sometimes called the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sol invictus</span>” itself, sometimes
the mighty companion and ruler of Helios; he holds
in his right hand the “bear constellation, which moves
and turns the heavens.” The bull-headed gods, equally
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱεροὶ καὶ ἄλκιμοι νεανίαι</span> with Mithra himself, to
whom the attribute <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεώτερος</span>, “young one,” “the newcomer,”
is given, are merely attributive components of
the same divinity. The chief god of the Mithraic liturgy
is himself subdivided into Mithra and Helios; the attributes
of each of these are closely related to the other.
Of Helios it is said: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄψει θεὸν νεώτερον εὐειδῆ πυρινό</span><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριχα
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>ἐν χιτῶνι λευκῷ καὶ χλαμύδι κοκκίνῃ, ἔχοντα
πύρινον στέφανον</span>.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c008'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Of Mithra it is said: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄψει θεὸν ὑπερμεγέθη, φωτινὴν
ἔχοντα τὴν ὄψιν, νεώτερον, χρυσοκόμαν, ἐν χιτῶνι λευκῳ
καὶ χρυσῳ στεφάνῳ καὶ ἀναξυρίσι, κατέχοντα τῇ δεξιᾷ
χειρὶ μόσχου ὦμόν χρύσεον, ὅς ἐστιν ἄρκτος ἡ κινοῦσα
καὶ ἀντιστρέφουσα τὸν οὐρανόν, κατὰ ὥραν ἀναπολεύουσα
καὶ καταπολεύουσα. ἔπειτα ὄψει αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν
ὀμμάτων ἀστραπὰς καὶ ἐκ τοῦ σώματος ἀστέρας ἁλλομένους.</span><a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c008'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>If we place fire and gold as essentially similar, then a
great accord is found in the attributes of the two gods.
To these mystical pagan ideas there deserve to be added
the probably almost contemporaneous vision of Revelation:</p>

<p class='c017'>“And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks. And
in the midst of the candlesticks<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c008'><sup>[162]</sup></a> one like unto the son of man,
clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the
breasts with a golden girdle. And his head and his hair were
white as white wool, white as snow, and his eyes were as a flame
of fire. And his feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been
refined in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
And he had in his right hand seven stars,<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c008'><sup>[163]</sup></a> and out of his mouth
proceeded a sharp two-edged sword,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c008'><sup>[164]</sup></a> and his countenance was
as the sun shineth in his strength.”—<cite>Rev.</cite> i: 12 ff.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And I looked, and beheld a white cloud, and upon the cloud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>I saw one sitting like unto the son of man, having on his head a
golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.”<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c008'><sup>[165]</sup></a>—<cite>Rev.</cite> xiv: 14.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and upon his head were
many diadems. And he was arrayed in a garment<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c008'><sup>[166]</sup></a> sprinkled
with blood.... And the armies which were in heaven followed
him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen,<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c008'><sup>[167]</sup></a> white and pure.
And out of his mouth proceeded a sharp sword.”—<cite>Rev.</cite> xix:
12–15.</p>

<p class='c007'>One need not assume that there is a direct dependency
between the Apocalypse and the Mithraic liturgy. The
visionary images of both texts are developed from a
source, not limited to one place, but found in the soul
of many divers people, because the symbols which arise
from it are too typical for it to belong to one individual
only. I put these images here to show how the primitive
symbolism of light gradually developed, with the increasing
depth of the vision, into the idea of the sun-hero, the
“well-beloved.”<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c008'><sup>[168]</sup></a> The development of the symbol of
light is thoroughly typical. In addition to this, perhaps
I might call to mind the fact that I have previously
pointed out this course with numerous examples,<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c008'><sup>[169]</sup></a> and,
therefore, I can spare myself the trouble of returning to
this subject.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c008'><sup>[170]</sup></a> These visionary occurrences are the psychological
roots of the sun-coronations in the mysteries.
Its rite is religious hallucination congealed into liturgical
form, which, on account of its great regularity, could become
a generally accepted outer form. After all this, it
is easily understood how the ancient Christian Church, on
one side, stood in an especial bond to Christ as “sol
novus,” and, on the other side, had a certain difficulty in
freeing itself from the earthly symbols of Christ. Indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Philo of Alexandria saw in the sun the image of the divine
logos or of the Deity especially (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Somniis</span>,” 1:85).
In an Ambrosian hymn Christ is invoked by “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">O sol
salutis</span>,” and so on. At the time of Marcus Aurelius,
Meliton, in his work,<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c008'><sup>[171]</sup></a> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περὶ λούτρου</span>, called Christ the

<p class='c007'>Still more important is a passage from Pseudo-Cyprian:<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c008'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>According to the testimony of Eusebius of Alexandria,
the Christians also shared in the worship of the rising
sun, which lasted into the fifth century:</p>

of the most remarkable works extant, where the Pagan,

<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐξήγησις περὶ των ἐν Περσίδι πραχθέντων</span>, edited by
Wirth.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c008'><sup>[182]</sup></a> This is a book of fables, but, nevertheless, a
mine for near-Christian phantasies, which gives a profound
insight into Christian symbolism. In this is found
the following magical dedication: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διὶ Ἡλίῳ θεῳ μεγάλῳ
βασιλεῖ Ἰησοῦ</span>—.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c008'><sup>[183]</sup></a> In certain parts of Armenia the
rising sun is still worshipped by Christians, that “it
may let its foot rest upon the faces of the worshippers.”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c008'><sup>[184]</sup></a>
The foot occurs as an anthropomorphic attribute,
and we have already met the theriomorphic
attribute in the feathers and the sun phallus. Other comparisons
of the sun’s ray, as knife, sword, arrow, and so
on, have also, as we have learned from the psychology
of the dream, a phallic meaning at bottom. This meaning
is attached to the foot as I here point out,<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c008'><sup>[185]</sup></a> and also
to the feathers, or hair, of the sun, which signify the
power or strength of the sun. I refer to the story of
Samson, and to that of the Apocalypse of Baruch, concerning
the phœnix bird, which, flying before the sun, loses
its feathers, and, exhausted, is strengthened again in an
ocean bath at evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the symbol of “moth and sun” we have dug
down into the historic depths of the soul, and in doing
this we have uncovered an old buried idol, the youthful,
beautiful, fire-encircled and halo-crowned sun-hero, who,
forever unattainable to the mortal, wanders upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>earth, causing night to follow day; winter, summer; death,
life; and who returns again in rejuvenated splendor and
gives light to new generations. The longing of the
dreamer concealed behind the moth stands for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ancient pre-Asiatic civilizations were acquainted
with a sun-worship having the idea of a God dying and
rising again (Osiris, Tammuz, Attis-Adonis),<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c008'><sup>[186]</sup></a> Christ,
Mithra and his bull,<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c008'><sup>[187]</sup></a> Phœnix and so on. The beneficent
power as well as the destroying power was worshipped in
fire. The forces of nature always have two sides, as we
have already seen in the God of Job. This reciprocal
bond brings us back once more to Miss Miller’s poem.
Her reminiscences support our previous supposition, that
the symbol of moth and sun is a condensation of two
ideas, about one of which we have just spoken; the other
is the moth and the flame. As the title of a play, about
the contents of which the author tells us absolutely nothing,
“Moth and Flame” may easily have the well-known
erotic meaning of flying around the flame of passion until
one’s wings are burned. The passionate longing, that is
to say, the libido, has its two sides; it is power which
beautifies everything, and which under other circumstances
destroys everything. It often appears as if one
could not accurately understand in what the destroying
quality of the creative power consists. A woman who
gives herself up to passion, particularly under the present-day
condition of culture, experiences the destructive side
only too soon. One has only to imagine one’s self a little
away from the every-day moral conditions in order to
understand what feelings of extreme insecurity overwhelm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the individual who gives himself unconditionally over to
Fate.</p>

<p class='c007'>To be fruitful means, indeed, to destroy one’s self, because
with the rise of the succeeding generation the previous
one has passed beyond its highest point; thus our
descendants are our most dangerous enemies, whom we
cannot overcome, for they will outlive us, and, therefore,
without fail, will take the power from our enfeebled
hands. The anxiety in the face of the erotic fate
is wholly understandable, for there is something immeasurable
therein. Fate usually hides unknown dangers, and
the perpetual hesitation of the neurotic to venture upon
life is easily explained by his desire to be allowed to stand
still, so as not to take part in the dangerous battle of life.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c008'><sup>[188]</sup></a>
<em>Whoever renounces the chance to experience must stifle
in himself the wish for it, and, therefore, commits a sort
of self-murder.</em> From this the death phantasies which
readily accompany the renunciation of the erotic wish
are made clear. In the poem <em>Miss Miller has voiced
these phantasies</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>She adds further to the material with the following:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I had been reading a selection from one of Byron’s poems
which pleased me very much and made a deep and lasting impression.
Moreover, the rhythm of my last two verses, ‘For I
the source, etc.,’ and the two lines of Byron’s are very similar.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Now let me die as I have lived in faith,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor tremble though the universe should quake.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This reminiscence with which the series of ideas is
closed confirms the death phantasies which follow from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>renunciation of the erotic wish. The quotation comes—which
Miss Miller did not mention—from an uncompleted
poem of Byron’s called “Heaven and Earth.”<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c008'><sup>[189]</sup></a> The
whole verse follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Still blessed be the Lord,</div>
      <div class='line'>For what is passed,</div>
      <div class='line'>For that which is;</div>
      <div class='line'>For all are His,</div>
      <div class='line'>From first to last—</div>
      <div class='line'>Time—Space—Eternity—Life—Death—</div>
      <div class='line'>The vast known and immeasurable unknown</div>
      <div class='line'>He made and can unmake,</div>
      <div class='line'>And shall I for a little gasp of breath</div>
      <div class='line'>Blaspheme and groan?</div>
      <div class='line'>No, let me die as I have lived in faith,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor quiver though the universe may quake!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The words are included in a kind of praise or prayer,
spoken by a “mortal” who is in hopeless flight before
the mounting deluge. Miss Miller puts herself in the
same situation in her quotation; that is to say, she readily
lets it be seen that her feeling is similar to the despondency
of the unhappy ones who find themselves hard
pressed by the threatening mounting waters of the deluge.
With this the writer allows us a deep look into the dark
abyss of her longing for the sun-hero. We see that her
longing is in vain; she is a mortal, only for a short time
borne upwards into the light by means of the highest
longing, and then sinking to death, or, much more, urged
upwards by the fear of death, like the people before the
deluge, and in spite of the desperate conflict, irretrievably
given over to destruction. This is a mood which recalls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>vividly the closing scene in “Cyrano de Bergerac”:<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c008'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>We already know sufficiently well what longing and
what impulse it is that attempts to clear a way for itself
to the light, but that it may be realized quite clearly and
irrevocably, it is shown plainly in the quotation “No, let
me die,” which confirms and completes all earlier remarks.
The divine, the “much-beloved,” who is honored in the
image of the sun, is also the goal of the longing of our
poet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Byron’s “Heaven and Earth” is a mystery founded on
the following passage from Genesis, chapter vi:2:
“And it came to pass&nbsp;... that the sons of God saw the
daughters of men that they were fair, and they took
them wives of all that they chose.” Byron offers as a
further motif for his poem the following passage from
Coleridge: “<em>And woman wailing for her Demon lover</em>.”
Byron’s poem is concerned with two great events, one
psychologic and one telluric; the passion which throws
down all barriers; and all the terrors of the unchained
powers of nature: a parallel which has already been introduced
into our earlier discussion. The angels Samiasa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and Azaziel burn with sinful love for the beautiful
daughters of Cain, Anah and Aholibama, and force a
way through the barrier which is placed between mortal
and immortal. They revolt as Lucifer once did against
God, and the archangel Raphael raises his voice warningly:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But man hath listened to his voice</div>
      <div class='line'>And ye to woman’s—beautiful she is,</div>
      <div class='line'>The serpent’s voice less subtle than her kiss.</div>
      <div class='line'>The snake but vanquished dust; but she will draw</div>
      <div class='line'>A second host from heaven to break heaven’s law.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The power of God is threatened by the seduction of
passion; a second fall of angels menaces heaven. Let us
translate this mythologic projection back into the psychologic,
from whence it originated. Then it would read:
the power of the good and reasonable ruling the world
wisely is threatened by the chaotic primitive power of passion;
therefore passion must be exterminated; that is to
say, projected into mythology. The race of Cain and
the whole sinful world must be destroyed from the roots
by the deluge. It is the inevitable result of that sinful
passion which has broken through all barriers. Its counterpart
is the sea and the waters of the deep and the
floods of rain,<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c008'><sup>[191]</sup></a> the generating, fructifying and “maternal
waters,” as the Indian mythology refers to them.
Now they leave their natural bounds and surge over the
mountain tops, engulfing all living things; for passion destroys
itself. The libido is God and Devil. With the
destruction of the sinfulness of the libido an essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>portion of the libido would be destroyed. Through the
loss of the Devil, God himself suffered a considerable loss,
somewhat like an amputation upon the body of the
Divinity. The mysterious hint in Raphael’s lament concerning
the two rebels, Samiasa and Azaziel, suggests
this.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in28'>“... Why,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cannot this earth be made, or be destroyed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without involving ever some vast void</div>
      <div class='line'>In the immortal ranks?...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Love raises man, not only above himself, but also
above the bounds of his mortality and earthliness, up to
divinity itself, and in the very act of raising him it destroys
him. Mythologically, this self-presumption finds
its striking expression in the building of the heaven-high
tower of Babel, which brings confusion to mankind.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c008'><sup>[192]</sup></a>
In Byron’s poem it is the sinful ambition of the race of
Cain, for love of which it makes even the stars subservient
and leads away the sons of God themselves. If,
indeed, longing for the highest things—if I may speak
so—is legitimate, then it lies in the circumstances that it
leaves its human boundaries, that of sinfulness, and,
therefore, destruction. The longing of the moth for the
star is not absolutely pure and transparent, but glows in
sultry mist, for man continues to be man. Through the
excess of his longing he draws down the divine into the
corruption of his passion;<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c008'><sup>[193]</sup></a> therefore, he seems to raise
himself to the Divine; but with that his humanity is destroyed.
Thus the love of Anah and Aholibama for their
angels becomes the ruin of gods and men. The invocation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>with which Cain’s daughters implore their angels is
psychologically an exact parallel to Miss Miller’s poem.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>The prophetic visions of Japhet have almost prophetic
meaning for our poetess; with the death of the moth in
the light, evil is once more laid aside; the complex has
once again, even if in a censored form, expressed itself.
With that, however, the problem is not solved; all sorrow
and every longing begins again from the beginning,
but there is “Promise in the Air”—the premonition of
the Redeemer, of the “Well-beloved,” of the Sun-hero,
who again mounts to the height of the sun and again
descends to the coldness of the winter, who is the light of
hope from race to race, the image of the libido.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PART II</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>ASPECTS OF THE LIBIDO</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>Before I enter upon the contents of this second part, it
seems necessary to cast a backward glance over the singular
train of thought which the analysis of the poem
“The Moth to the Sun” has produced. Although this
poem is very different from the foregoing Hymn of Creation,
closer investigation of the “longing for the sun”
has carried us into the realm of the fundamental ideas of
religion and astral mythology, which ideas are closely
related to those considered in the first poem. The creative
God of the first poem, whose dual nature, moral and
physical, was shown especially clearly to us by Job, has
in the second poem a new qualification of astral-mythological,
or, to express it better, of astrological character.
The God becomes the sun, and in this finds an adequate
natural expression quite apart from the moral division of
the God idea into the heavenly father and the devil.
The sun is, as Renan remarked, really the only rational
representation of God, whether we take the point of
view of the barbarians of other ages or that of the modern
physical sciences. In both cases the sun is the parent God,
mythologically predominantly the Father God, from
whom all living things draw life; He is the fructifier and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>creator of all that lives, the source of energy of our
world. The discord into which the soul of man has fallen
through the action of moral laws<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c008'><sup>[204]</sup></a> can be resolved
into complete harmony through the sun as the natural
object which obeys no human moral law. The sun is not
only beneficial, but also destructive; therefore the zodiacal
representation of the August heat is the herd-devouring
lion whom the Jewish hero Samson<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c008'><sup>[205]</sup></a> killed in order to
free the parched earth from this plague. Yet it is the
harmonious and inherent nature of the sun to scorch, and
its scorching power seems natural to men. It shines
equally on the just and on the unjust, and allows useful
living objects to flourish as well as harmful ones. Therefore,
the sun is adapted as is nothing else to represent
the visible God of this world. That is to say, that driving
strength of our own soul, which we call libido, and
whose nature it is to allow the useful and injurious, the
good and the bad to proceed. That this comparison is no
mere play of words is taught us by the mystics. When
by looking inwards (introversion) and going down into
the depths of their own being they find “in their heart”
the image of the Sun, they find their own love or libido,
which with reason, I might say with physical reason, is
called the Sun; for our source of energy and life is the
Sun. Thus our life substance, as an energic process, is
entirely Sun. Of what special sort this “Sun energy”
seen inwardly by the mystic is, is shown by an example
taken from the Hindoo mythology.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c008'><sup>[206]</sup></a> From the explanation
of Part III of the “Shvetâshvataropanishad” we
take the following quotation, which relates to the Rudra:<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c008'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>(2) “Yea, the one Rudra who all these worlds with ruling
power doth rule, stands not for any second. Behind those that
are born he stands; at ending time ingathers all the worlds he
hath evolved, protector (he).</p>

<p class='c017'>(3) “He hath eyes on all sides, on all sides surely hath faces,
arms surely on all sides, on all sides feet. With arms, with wings
he tricks them out, creating heaven and earth, the only God.</p>

<p class='c017'>(4) “Who of the gods is both the source and growth, the Lord
of all, the Rudra. Mighty seer; who brought the shining germ
of old into existence—may he with reason pure conjoin us.”<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c008'><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>These attributes allow us clearly to discern the all-creator
and in him the Sun, which has wings and with a
thousand eyes scans the world.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c008'><sup>[209]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The following passages confirm the text and join to it
the idea most important for us, that God is also contained
in the individual creature:</p>

<p class='c017'>(7) “Beyond this (world) the Brahman beyond, the mighty
one, in every creature hid according to its form, the one encircling
Lord of all, Him having known, immortal they become.</p>

<p class='c017'>(8) “I know this mighty man, Sun-like, beyond the darkness,
Him (and him) only knowing, one crosseth over death; no other
path (at all) is there to go.</p>

<p class='c017'>(11) “... spread over the universe is He the Lord therefore
as all-pervader, He’s benign.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The powerful God, the equal of the Sun, is in that
one, and whoever knows him is immortal.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c008'><sup>[210]</sup></a> Going on
further with the text, we come upon a new attribute,
which informs us in what form and manner Rudra lived
in men.</p>

<p class='c017'>(12) “The mighty monarch, He, the man, the one who doth
the essence start towards that peace of perfect stainlessness, lordly,
exhaustless light.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>(13) “The Man, the size of a thumb, the inner self, sits
ever in the heart of all that’s born, by mind, mind ruling in the
heart, is He revealed. That they who know, immortal they become.</p>

<p class='c017'>(14) “The Man of the thousands of heads (and) thousands
of eyes (and) thousands of feet, covering the earth on all sides,
He stands beyond, ten finger-breadths.</p>

<p class='c017'>(15) “The Man is verily this all, (both) what has been and
what will be, Lord (too) of deathlessness which far all else
surpasses.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Important parallel quotations are to be found in the
“Kathopanishad,” section 2, part 4.</p>

<p class='c017'>(12) “The Man of the size of a thumb, resides in the midst
within the self, of the past and the future, the Lord.</p>

<p class='c017'>(13) “The Man of the size of a thumb like flame free from
smoke, of past and of future the Lord, the same is to-day, to-morrow
the same will He be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Who this Tom-Thumb is can easily be divined—the
phallic symbol of the libido. The phallus is this hero
dwarf, who performs great deeds; he, this ugly god
in homely form, who is the great doer of wonders,
since he is the visible expression of the creative strength
incarnate in man. This extraordinary contrast is also
very striking in “Faust” (the mother scene):</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Here the devil again puts into Faust’s hand the marvellous
tool, a phallic symbol of the libido, as once before
in the beginning the devil, in the form of the black dog,
accompanied Faust, when he introduced himself with the
words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“Part of that power, not understood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which always wills the bad and always creates the good.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>United to this strength, Faust succeeded in accomplishing
his real life task, at first through evil adventure and
then for the benefit of humanity, for without the evil
there is no creative power. Here in the mysterious
mother scene, where the poet unveils the last mystery of
the creative power to the initiated, Faust has need of the
phallic magic wand (in the magic strength of which he
has at first no confidence), in order to perform the
greatest of wonders, namely, the creation of Paris and
Helen. With that Faust attains the divine power of
working miracles, and, indeed, only by means of this
small, insignificant instrument. This paradoxical impression
seems to be very ancient, for even the Upanishads
could say the following of the dwarf god:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>(19) “Without hands, without feet, He moveth, He graspeth:
Eyeless He seeth, (and) earless He heareth: He knoweth what is
to be known, yet is there no knower of Him. Him call the first,
mighty the Man.</p>

<p class='c017'>(20) “Smaller than small, (yet) greater than great in the
heart of this creature the self doth repose&nbsp;... etc.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The phallus is the being, which moves without limbs,
which sees without eyes, which knows the future; and as
symbolic representative of the universal creative power
existent everywhere immortality is vindicated in it. It is
always thought of as entirely independent, an idea current
not only in antiquity, but also apparent in the pornographic
drawings of our children and artists. It is a seer,
an artist and a worker of wonders; therefore it should
not surprise us when certain phallic characteristics are
found again in the mythological seer, artist and sorcerer.
Hephaestus, Wieland the smith, and Mani, the founder
of Manicheism, whose followers were also famous, have
crippled feet. The ancient seer Melampus possessed a
suggestive name (Blackfoot),<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c008'><sup>[212]</sup></a> and it seems also to be
typical for seers to be blind. Dwarfed stature, ugliness
and deformity have become especially typical for those
mysterious chthonian gods, the sons of Hephaestus, the
Cabiri,<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c008'><sup>[213]</sup></a> to whom great power to perform miracles was
ascribed. The name signifies “powerful,” and the Samothracian
cult is most intimately united with that of the ithyphallic
Hermes, who, according to the account of Herodotus,
was brought to Attica by the Pelasgians. They are
also called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεγάλοι θεοί</span>, the great gods. Their near
relations are the “Idaean dactyli” (finger or Idaean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>thumb),<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c008'><sup>[214]</sup></a> to whom the mother of the gods had taught the
blacksmith’s art. (“The key will scent the true place
from all others! follow it down!—’twill lead thee to the
Mothers!”) They were the first leaders, the teachers of
Orpheus, and invented the Ephesian magic formulas and
the musical rhythms.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c008'><sup>[215]</sup></a> The characteristic disparity
which is shown above in the Upanishad text, and in
“Faust,” is also found here, since the gigantic Hercules
passed as an Idaean dactyl.</p>

<p class='c007'>The colossal Phrygians, the skilled servants of Rhea,<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c008'><sup>[216]</sup></a>
were also Dactyli. The Babylonian teacher of wisdom,
Oannes,<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c008'><sup>[217]</sup></a> was represented in a phallic fish form.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c008'><sup>[218]</sup></a> The
two sun heroes, the Dioscuri, stand in relation to the
Cabiri;<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c008'><sup>[219]</sup></a> they also wear the remarkable pointed head-covering
(Pileus) which is peculiar to these mysterious
gods,<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c008'><sup>[220]</sup></a> and which is perpetuated from that time on as a
secret mark of identification. Attis (the elder brother of
Christ) wears the pointed cap, just as does Mithra. It
has also become traditional for our present-day chthonian
infantile gods,<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c008'><sup>[221]</sup></a> the brownies (Penates), and all the
typical kind of dwarfs. Freud<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c008'><sup>[222]</sup></a> has already called our attention
to the phallic meaning of the hat in modern phantasies.
A further significance is that probably the pointed
cap represents the foreskin. In order not to go too far
afield from my theme, I must be satisfied here merely
to present the suggestion. But at a later opportunity I
shall return to this point with detailed proof.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dwarf form leads to the figure of the divine boy,
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">puer eternus</span></i>, the young Dionysus, Jupiter Anxurus,
Tages,<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c008'><sup>[223]</sup></a> and so on. In the vase painting of Thebes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>already mentioned, a bearded Dionysus is represented
as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΚΑΒΕΙΡΟΣ</span>, together with a figure of a boy as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Παῖς</span>,
followed by a caricatured boy’s figure designated as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΠΡΑΤΟΛΑΟΣ</span> and then again a caricatured man, which
is represented as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΜΙΤΟΣ</span>.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c008'><sup>[224]</sup></a> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μίτος</span> really means thread,
but in orphic speech it stands for semen. It was conjectured
that this collection corresponded to a group of
statuary in the sanctuary of a cult. This supposition is
supported by the history of the cult as far as it is known;
it is an original Phœnician cult of father and son;<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c008'><sup>[225]</sup></a> of
an old and young Cabir who were more or less assimilated
with the Grecian gods. The double figures of the
adult and the child Dionysus lend themselves particularly
to this assimilation. One might also call this the cult
of the large and small man. Now, under various aspects,
Dionysus is a phallic god in whose worship the phallus
held an important place; for example, in the cult of the
Argivian Bull—Dionysus. Moreover, the phallic herme
of the god has given occasion for a personification of the
phallus of Dionysus, in the form of the god Phales,
who is nothing else but a Priapus. He is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑταῖρος</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύγκωμος Βάκχου</span><a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c008'><sup>[226]</sup></a>.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c008'><sup>[227]</sup></a> Corresponding to this state
of affairs, one cannot very well fail to recognize in the previously
mentioned Cabiric representation, and in the
added boy’s figure, the picture of man and his penis.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c008'><sup>[228]</sup></a> The
previously mentioned paradox in the Upanishad text
of large and small, of giant and dwarf, is expressed more
mildly here by man and boy, or father and son.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c008'><sup>[229]</sup></a> The
motive of deformity which is used constantly by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Cabiric cult is present also in the vase picture, while the
parallel figures to Dionysus and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Παῖς</span> are the caricatured
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μίτος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πρατόλαος</span>. Just as formerly the difference
in size gave occasion for division, so does the
deformity here.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c008'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Without first bringing further proof to bear, I may
remark that from this knowledge especially strong sidelights
are thrown upon the original psychologic meaning
of the religious heroes. Dionysus stands in an intimate
relation with the psychology of the early Asiatic God
who died and rose again from the dead and whose manifold
manifestations have been brought together in the
figure of Christ into a firm personality enduring for centuries.
We gain from our premise the knowledge that
these heroes, as well as their typical fates, are personifications
of the human libido and its typical fates. They
are imagery, like the figures of our nightly dreams—the
actors and interpreters of our secret thoughts. And since
we, in the present day, have the power to decipher the
symbolism of dreams and thereby surmise the mysterious
psychologic history of development of the individual,
so a way is here opened to the understanding of
the secret springs of impulse beneath the psychologic
development of races. Our previous trains of thought,
which demonstrate the phallic side of the symbolism of
the libido, also show how thoroughly justified is the term
“libido.”<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c008'><sup>[231]</sup></a> Originally taken from the sexual sphere,
this word has become the most frequent technical expression
of psychoanalysis, for the simple reason that its
significance is wide enough to cover all the unknown and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>countless manifestations of the Will in the sense of Schopenhauer.
It is sufficiently comprehensive and rich in
meaning to characterize the real nature of the psychical
entity which it includes. The exact classical significance
of the word libido qualifies it as an entirely appropriate
term. Libido is taken in a very wide sense in
Cicero:<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c008'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">(Volunt ex duobus opinatis) bonis (nasci) Libidinem et
Lætitiam; ut sit lætitia præsentium bonorum: libido futurorum.—Lætitia
autem et Libido in bonorum opinione versantur, cum
Libido ad id, quod videtur bonum, illecta et inflammata rapiatur.—Natura
enim omnes ea, quæ bona videntur, sequuntur, fugiuntque
contraria. Quamobrem simul objecta species cuiuspiam
est, quod bonum videatur, ad id adipiscendum impellit ipsa natura.
Id cum constanter prudenterque fit, ejusmodi appetitionem stoici
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βούλησιν</span> appellant, nos appellamus voluntatem; eam illi putant

stultis invenitur.</span>”<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c008'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The meaning of libido here is “to wish,” and in the
stoical distinction of will, dissolute desire. Cicero<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c008'><sup>[234]</sup></a> used
“libido” in a corresponding sense:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the same sense Sallust says:</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iracundia pars est libidinis.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In another place in a milder and more general sense,
which completely approaches the analytical use:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magisque in decoris armis et militaribus equis, quam in
scortis et conviviis libidinem habebant.</span>”<a href='#f235' class='c008'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod si tibi bona libido fuerit patriæ, etc.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The use of libido is so general that the phrase “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libido
est scire</span>” merely had the significance of “I will, it pleases
me.” In the phrase “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliquam libido urinæ lacessit</span>”
libido had the meaning of urgency. The significance of
sexual desire is also present in the classics.</p>

<p class='c007'>This general classical application of the conception
agrees with the corresponding etymological context of
the word, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libido</span></i> or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lubido</span></i> (with <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libet</span></i>, more ancient

</div>

<p class='c006'>The chief source of the history of the analytic conception
of libido is Freud’s “Three Contributions to the
Sexual Theory.” There the term libido is conceived by
him in the original narrow sense of sexual impulse, sexual
need. Experience forces us to the assumption of a
capacity for displacement of the libido, because functions
or localizations of non-sexual force are undoubtedly
capable of taking up a certain amount of libidinous sexual
impetus, a libidinous afflux.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c008'><sup>[238]</sup></a> Functions or objects could,
therefore, obtain sexual value, which under normal circumstances
really have nothing to do with sexuality.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c008'><sup>[239]</sup></a>
From this fact results the Freudian comparison of the
libido with a stream, which is divisible, which can be
dammed up, which overflows into branches, and so on.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c008'><sup>[240]</sup></a>
Freud’s original conception does not interpret “everything
sexual,” although this has been asserted by critics,
but recognizes the existence of certain forces, the nature
of which are not well known; to which Freud, however,
compelled by the notorious facts which are evident to
any layman, grants the capacity to receive “affluxes of
libido.” The hypothetical idea at the basis is the symbol
of the “Triebbündel”<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c008'><sup>[241]</sup></a> (bundle of impulses), wherein
the sexual impulse figures as a partial impulse of the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>system, and its encroachment into the other realms of
impulse is a fact of experience. The theory of Freud,
branching off from this interpretation, according to which
the motor forces of a neurotic system correspond precisely
to their libidinous additions to other (non-sexual)
functional impulses, has been sufficiently proven as correct,
it seems to me, by the work of Freud and his school.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c008'><sup>[242]</sup></a>
Since the appearance of the “Three Contributions,” in
1905, a change has taken place<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c008'><sup>[243]</sup></a> in the libido conception;
its field of application has been widened. An extremely
clear example of this amplification is this present work.
However, I must state that Freud, as well as myself,
saw the need of widening the conception of libido. It
was paranoia, so closely related to dementia præcox,
which seemed to compel Freud to enlarge the earlier
limits of the conception. The passage in question, which
I will quote here, word for word, reads:<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c008'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“A third consideration which presents itself, in regard to the
views developed here, starts the query as to whether we should
accept as sufficiently effectual the universal receding of the libido
from the outer world, in order to interpret from that, the end of
the world: or whether in this case, the firmly rooted possession
of the ‘I’ must not suffice to uphold the rapport with the outer
world. Then one must either let that which we call possession
of the libido (interest from erotic sources) coincide with interest
in general, or else take into consideration the possibility that great
disturbance in the disposition of the libido can also induce a corresponding
disturbance in the possession of the ‘I.’ Now, these are
the problems, which we are still absolutely helpless and unfitted
to answer. Things would be different could we proceed from a
safe fund of knowledge of instinct. But the truth is, we have
nothing of that kind at our disposal. We understand instinct
as the resultant of the reaction of the somatic and the psychic.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>We see in it the psychical representation of organic forces and
take the popular distinction between the ‘I’ impulse and the
sexual impulse, which appears to us to be in accord with the
biological double rôle of the individual being who aspires to his
own preservation as well as to the preservation of the species.
But anything beyond this is a structure, which we set up, and
also willingly let fall again in order to orient ourselves in the
confusion of the dark processes of the soul; we expect particularly,
from the psychoanalytic investigations into diseased soul processes,
to have certain decisions forced upon us in regard to questions of
the theory of instinct. This expectation has not yet been fulfilled
on account of the still immature and limited investigations in these
fields. At present the possibility of the reaction of libido disturbance
upon the possession of the ‘I’ can be shown as little
as the reverse; the secondary or induced disturbances of the
libido processes through abnormal changes in the ‘I.’ It is probable
that processes of this sort form the distinctive character of
the psychoses. The conclusions arising from this, in relation to
paranoia, are at present uncertain. One cannot assert that the
paranoiac has completely withdrawn his interest from the outer
world, nor withdrawn into the heights of repression, as one sometimes
sees in certain other forms of hallucinatory psychoses. He
takes notice of the outer world, he takes account of its changes, he
is stirred to explanations by their influence, and therefore I consider
it highly probable that the changed relation to the world is
to be explained, wholly or in great part, by the deficiency of the
libido interest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In this passage Freud plainly touches upon the question
whether the well-known longing for reality of the
paranoic dement (and the dementia præcox patients),<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c008'><sup>[245]</sup></a>
to whom I have especially called attention in my book,
“The Psychology of Dementia Præcox,”<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c008'><sup>[246]</sup></a> is to be traced
back to the withdrawal of the “libidinous affluxes”
alone, or whether this coincides with the so-called objective
interest in general. It is hardly to be assumed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>that the normal “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fonction du réel</span>” (Janet)<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c008'><sup>[247]</sup></a> is maintained
only through affluxes of libido or erotic interest.
The fact is that in very many cases reality disappears
entirely, so that not a trace of psychological adaptation
or orientation can be recognized. Reality is repressed
under these circumstances and replaced by the contents
of the complex. One must of necessity say that not only
the erotic interest but the interest in general has disappeared,
that is to say, the whole adaptation to reality has
ceased. To this category belong the stuporose and catatonic
automatons.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have previously made use of the expression “psychic
energy” in my “Psychology of Dementia Præcox” because
I was unable to establish the theory of this psychosis
upon the conception of the displacement of the
affluxes of libido. My experience, at that time chiefly
psychiatric, did not enable me to understand this theory.
However, the correctness of this theory in regard to
neuroses, strictly speaking the transference neuroses, was
proven to me later after increased experience in the field
of hysteria and compulsion neuroses. In the territory
of these neuroses it is mainly a question whether any
portion of the libido which is spared through the specific
repression becomes introverted and regressive into
earlier paths of transference; for example, the path of
the parental transference.<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c008'><sup>[248]</sup></a> With that, however, the
former non-sexual psychologic adaptation to the environment
remains preserved so far as it does not concern the
erotic and its secondary positions (symptoms). The
reality which is lacking to the patients is just that portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>of the libido to be found in the neurosis. In dementia
præcox, on the contrary, not merely that portion of libido
which is saved in the well-known specific sexual repression
is lacking for reality, but much more than one could write
down to the account of sexuality in a strict sense. The
function of reality is lacking to such a degree that even
the motive power must be encroached upon in the loss.
The sexual character of this must be disputed absolutely,<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c008'><sup>[249]</sup></a>
for reality is not understood to be a sexual function.
Moreover, if that were so, the introversion of the libido
in the strict sense must have as a result a loss of reality
in the neuroses, and, indeed, a loss which could be compared
with that of dementia præcox. These facts have
rendered it impossible for me to transfer Freud’s theory
of libido to dementia præcox, and, therefore, I am of
the opinion that Abraham’s investigation<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c008'><sup>[250]</sup></a> is hardly tenable
theoretically, from the standpoint of the Freudian
theory of libido. If Abraham believes that through the
withdrawal of the libido from the outer world the paranoid
system or the schizophrenic symptomatology results,
then this assumption is not justified from the standpoint
of the knowledge of that time, because a mere libido introversion
and regression leads, speedily, as Freud has
clearly shown, into the neuroses, and, strictly speaking,
into the transference neuroses, and not into dementia
præcox. Therefore, the transference of the libido theory
to dementia præcox is impossible, because this illness
produces a loss of reality which cannot be explained by
the deficiency of the libido defined in this narrow sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>It affords me especial satisfaction that our teacher also,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>when he laid his hand on the delicate material of the paranoic
psychology, was forced to doubt the applicability of
the conception of libido held by him at that time. The
sexual definition of this did not permit me to understand
those disturbances of function, which affect the vague territory
of the hunger instinct just as much as that of the
sexual instinct. For a long time the theory of libido
seemed to me inapplicable to dementia præcox. With
increasing experience in analytical work, however, I became
aware of a gradual change in my conception of
libido. In place of the descriptive definition of the
“Three Contributions” there gradually grew up a generic<a id='t144'></a>
definition of the libido, which rendered it possible for me
to replace the expression “psychic energy” by the term
“libido.” I was forced to ask myself whether indeed the
function of reality to-day does not consist only in its
smaller part of libido sexualis and in the greater part of
other impulses? It is still a very important question
whether phylogenetically the function of reality is not, at
least in great part, of sexual origin. To answer this question
directly in regard to the function of reality is not
possible, but we shall attempt to come to an understanding
indirectly.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fleeting glance at the history of evolution is sufficient
to teach us that countless complicated functions to which
to-day must be denied any sexual character were originally
pure derivations from the general impulse of
propagation. During the ascent through the animal kingdom
an important displacement in the fundamentals of
the procreative instinct has taken place. The mass of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the reproductive products with the uncertainty of fertilization
has more and more been replaced by a controlled
impregnation and an effective protection of the offspring.
In this way part of the energy required in the production
of eggs and sperma has been transposed into the creation
of mechanisms for allurement and for protection of the
young. Thus we discover the first instincts of art in animals
used in the service of the impulse of creation, and
limited to the breeding season. The original sexual character
of these biological institutions became lost in their
organic fixation and functional independence. Even if
there can be no doubt about the sexual origin of music,
still it would be a poor, unæsthetic generalization if one
were to include music in the category of sexuality. A
similar nomenclature would then lead us to classify the
cathedral of Cologne as mineralogy because it is built
of stones. It can be a surprise only to those to whom the
history of evolution is unknown to find how few things
there really are in human life which cannot be reduced in
the last analysis to the instinct of procreation. It includes
very nearly everything, I think, which is beloved and dear
to us. We spoke just now of libido as the creative impulse
and at the same time we allied ourselves with the
conception which opposes libido to hunger in the same way
that the instinct of the preservation of the species is
opposed to the instinct of self-preservation. In nature,
this artificial distinction does not exist. Here we see only
a continuous life impulse, a will to live which will attain
the creation of the whole species through the preservation
of the individual. Thus far this conception coincides with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the idea of the Will in Schopenhauer, for we can conceive
Will objectively, only as a manifestation of an internal
desire. This throwing of psychological perceptions into
material reality is characterized philosophically as “introjection.”
(Ferenczi’s conception of “introjection”
denoted the reverse, that is, the taking of the outer world
into the inner world.)<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c008'><sup>[251]</sup></a> Naturally, the conception of the
world was distorted by introjection. Freud’s conception
of the principle of desire is a voluntary formulation of the
idea of introjection, while his once more voluntarily conceived
“principle of reality” corresponds functionally to
that which I designate as “corrective of reality,” and R.
Avenarius<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c008'><sup>[252]</sup></a> designates as “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">empiriokritische Prinzipialkoordination.</span>”
The conception of power owes its existence
to this very introjection; this has already been said
expressively by Galileo in his remark that its origin is
to be sought in the subjective perception of the muscular
power of the individual. Because we have already arrived
at the daring assumption that the libido, which was employed
originally in the exclusive service of egg and seed
production, now appears firmly organized in the function
of nest-building, and can no longer be employed otherwise;
similarly this conception forces us to relate it to
every desire, including hunger. For now we can no longer
make any essential distinction between the will to build a
nest and the will to eat. This view brings us to a conception
of libido, which extends over the boundaries of the
physical sciences into a philosophical aspect—to a conception
of the will in general. I must give this bit of
psychological “Voluntarismus” into the hands of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>philosophers for them to manage. For the rest I refer
to the words of Schopenhauer<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c008'><sup>[253]</sup></a> relating to this. In connection
with the psychology of this conception (by which
I understand neither metapsychology nor metaphysics) I
am reminded here of the cosmogenic meaning of Eros in
Plato and Hesiod,<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c008'><sup>[254]</sup></a> and also of the orphic figure of
Phanes, the “<em>shining one</em>,” the first created, the “father
of Eros.” Phanes has also orphically the significance of
Priapus; he is a god of love, bisexual and similar to the
Theban Dionysus Lysios.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c008'><sup>[255]</sup></a> The orphic meaning of
Phanes is similar to that of the Indian Kâma, the god of
love, which is also the cosmogenic principle. To Plotinus,
of the Neo-Platonic school, the world-soul is the energy
of the intellect.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c008'><sup>[256]</sup></a> Plotinus compares “The One,” the creative
primal principle, with light in general; the intellect
with the Sun (♂), the world-soul with the moon (♀).
In another comparison Plotinus compares “The One”
with the Father, the intellect with the Son.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c008'><sup>[257]</sup></a> The “One”
designated as Uranus is transcendent. The son as Kronos
has dominion over the visible world. The world-soul
(designated as Zeus) appears as subordinate to him. The
“One,” or the Usia of the whole existence is designated
by Plotinus as hypostatic, also as the three forms of emanation,
also <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μία οὐσία ἐν τρισὶν ὑποστάσεσιν</span>.<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c008'><sup>[258]</sup></a> As Drews
observed, this is also the formula of the Christian
Trinity (God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
Ghost) as it was decided upon at the councils of Nicea
and Constantinople.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c008'><sup>[259]</sup></a> It may also be noticed that certain
early Christian sectarians attributed a maternal significance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>to the Holy Ghost (world-soul, moon). (See what
follows concerning Chi of Timæus.) According to Plotinus,
the world-soul has a tendency toward a divided
existence and towards divisibility, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">conditio sine qua
non</span></i> of all change, creation and procreation (also a maternal
quality). It is an “unending all of life” and
wholly energy; it is a living organism of ideas, which
attain in it effectiveness and reality.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c008'><sup>[260]</sup></a> The intellect is
its procreator, its father, which, having conceived it,
brings it to development in thought.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c008'><sup>[261]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“What lies enclosed in the intellect, comes to development in
the world-soul as logos, fills it with meaning and makes it as if
intoxicated with nectar.”<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c008'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Nectar is analogous to soma, the drink of fertility and
of life, also to sperma. The soul is fructified by the
intellect; as oversoul it is called heavenly Aphrodite, as
the undersoul the earthly Aphrodite. “It knows the birth
pangs,”<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c008'><sup>[263]</sup></a> and so on. The bird of Aphrodite, the dove,
is not without good cause the symbol of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class='c007'>This fragment of the history of philosophy, which may
easily be enlarged, shows the significance of the endopsychic
perception of the libido and of its symbolism in
human thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the diversity of natural phenomena we see the desire,
the libido, in the most diverse applications and forms.
We see the libido in the stage of childhood almost wholly
occupied in the instinct of nutrition, which takes care of
the upbuilding of the body. With the development of the
body there are successively opened new spheres of application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>for the libido. The last sphere of application, and
surpassing all the others in its functional significance, is
sexuality, which seems at first almost bound up with the
function of nutrition. (Compare with this the influence on
procreation of the conditions of nutrition in lower animals
and plants.) In the territory of sexuality, the libido
wins that formation, the enormous importance of which
has justified us in the use of the term libido in general.
Here the libido appears very properly as an impulse of
procreation, and almost in the form of an undifferentiated
sexual primal libido, as an energy of growth, which
clearly forces the individual towards division, budding,
etc. (The clearest distinction between the two forms of
libido is to be found among those animals in whom the
stage of nutrition is separated from the sexual stage by
a chrysalis stage.)</p>

<p class='c007'>From that sexual primal libido which produced millions
of eggs and seeds from one small creature derivatives
have been developed with the great limitation of the
fecundity; derivatives in which the functions are maintained
by a special differentiated libido. This differentiated
libido is henceforth desexualized because it is dissociated
from its original function of egg and sperma
production; nor is there any possibility of restoring it to
its original function. Thus, in general, the process of
development consists in an increasing transformation of
the primal libido which only produced products of
generation to the secondary functions of allurement and
protection of the young. This now presupposes a very
different and very complicated relation to reality, a true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>function of reality, which, functionally inseparable, is
bound up with the needs of procreation. Thus the altered
mode of procreation carries with it as a correlate a correspondingly
heightened adaptation to reality.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c008'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In this way we attain an insight into certain primitive
conditions of the function of reality. It would be radically
wrong to say that its compelling power is a sexual one.
It was a sexual one to a large extent. The process of
transformation of the primal libido into secondary impulses
always took place in the form of affluxes of sexual
libido, that is to say, sexuality became deflected from its
original destination and a portion of it turned, little by
little, increasing in amount, into the phylogenetic impulse
of the mechanisms of allurement and of protection of the
young. This diversion of the sexual libido from the
sexual territory into associated functions is still taking
place.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c008'><sup>[265]</sup></a> Where this operation succeeds without injury to
the adaptation of the individual it is called <em>sublimation</em>.
Where the attempt does not succeed it is called <em>repression</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The descriptive standpoint of psychology accepts the
multiplicity of instincts, among which is the sexual instinct,
as a special phenomenon; moreover, it recognizes certain
affluxes of libido to non-sexual instincts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quite otherwise is the genetic standpoint. It regards
the multiplicity of instincts as issuing from a relative
unity, the primal libido;<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c008'><sup>[266]</sup></a> it recognizes that definite
amounts of the primal libido are split off, as it were, associated
with the newly formed functions and finally merged
in them. As a result of this it is impossible, from the
genetic standpoint, to hold to the strictly limited conception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of libido of the descriptive standpoint; it leads inevitably
to a broadening of the conception. With this we
come to the theory of libido that I have surreptitiously
introduced into the first part of this work for the purpose
of making this genetic conception familiar to the
reader. The explanation of this harmless deceit I have
saved until the second part.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first time, through this genetic idea of libido,
which in every way surpasses the descriptive sexual, the
transference was made possible of the Freudian libido
theory into the psychology of mental disease. The passage
quoted above shows how the present Freudian conception
of libido collides with the problem of the
psychoses.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c008'><sup>[267]</sup></a> Therefore, when I speak of libido, I associate
with it the genetic conception which contains not
only the immediate sexual but also an amount of desexualized
primal libido. When I say a sick person takes his
libido away from the outer world, in order to take possession
of the inner world with it, I do not mean that
he takes away merely the affluxes from the function of
reality, but he takes energy away, according to my view,
from those desexualized instincts which regularly and
properly support the function of reality.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this alteration in the libido conception, certain
parts of our terminology need revision as well. As we
know, Abraham has undertaken the experiment of transferring
the Freudian libido theory to dementia præcox
and has conceived the characteristic lack of rapport and
the cessation of the function of reality as autoerotism.
This conception needs revision. Hysterical introversion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>of the libido leads to autoerotism, since the patient’s erotic
afflux of libido designed for the function of adaptation
is introverted, whereby his ego is occupied by the corresponding
amount of erotic libido. The schizophrenic,
however, shuns reality far more than merely the erotic
afflux would account for; therefore, his inner condition is
very different from that of the hysteric. He is more than
autoerotic, he builds up an intra-psychic equivalent for
reality, for which purpose he has necessarily to employ
other dynamics than that afforded by the erotic afflux.
Therefore, I must grant to Bleuler the right to reject the
conception of autoerotism, taken from the study of hysterical
neuroses, and there legitimate, and to replace it
by the conception of autismus.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c008'><sup>[268]</sup></a> I am forced to say that
this term is better fitted to facts than autoerotism. With
this I acknowledge my earlier idea of the identity of
autismus (Bleuler) and autoerotism (Freud) as unjustified,
and, therefore, retract it.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c008'><sup>[269]</sup></a> This thorough revision
of the conception of libido has compelled me to this.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these considerations it follows necessarily that
the descriptive psychologic conception of libido must be
given up in order for the libido theory to be applied to
dementia præcox. That it is there applicable is best
shown in Freud’s brilliant investigation of Schreber’s
phantasies. The question now is whether this genetic
conception of libido proposed by me is suitable for the
neuroses. I believe that this question may be answered
affirmatively. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Natura non fecit saltum</span>”—it is not merely
to be expected but it is also probable that at least temporary
functional disturbances of various degrees appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>in the neuroses, which transcend the boundaries of the
immediate sexual; in any case, this occurs in psychotic
episodes. I consider the broadening of the conception of
libido which has developed through the most recent analytic
work as a real advance which will prove of especial
advantage in the important field of the introversion psychoses.
Proofs of the correctness of my assumption are
already at hand. It has become apparent through a series
of researches of the Zurich School, which are now published
in part,<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c008'><sup>[270]</sup></a> that the phantastic substitution products
which take the place of the disturbed function of reality
bear unmistakable traces of archaic thought. This confirmation
is parallel to the postulate asserted above, according
to which reality is deprived, not merely of an
immediate (individual) amount of libido, but also of an
already differentiated or desexualized quantity of libido,
which, among normal people, has belonged to the function
of reality ever since prehistoric times. <em>A dropping away
of the last acquisition of the function of reality (or adaptation)
must of necessity be replaced by an earlier mode of
adaptation.</em> We find this principle already in the doctrines
of the neuroses, that is, that a repression resulting
from the failure of the recent transference is replaced by
an old way of transference, namely, through a regressive
revival of the parent imago. In the transference neurosis
(hysterical), where merely a part of the <em>immediate
sexual</em> libido is taken away from reality by the specific
sexual repression, the substituted product is a phantasy
of individual origin and significance, with only a trace
of those archaic traits found in the phantasies of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>mental disorders in which a portion of the general human
function of reality organized since antiquity has broken
off. This portion can be replaced only by a generally
valid archaic surrogate. We owe a simple and clear example
of this proposition to the investigation of Honegger.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c008'><sup>[271]</sup></a>
A paranoic of good intelligence who has a clear
idea of the spherical form of the earth and its rotation
around the sun replaces the modern astronomical views
by a system worked out in great detail, which one must
call archaic, in which the earth is a flat disc over which
the sun travels.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c008'><sup>[272]</sup></a> (I am reminded of the sun-phallus
mentioned in the first part of this book, for which we are
also indebted to Honegger.) Spielrein has likewise furnished
some very interesting examples of archaic definitions
which begin in certain illnesses to overlay the real
meanings of the modern word. For example, Spielrein’s
patient had correctly discovered the mythological significance
of alcohol, the intoxicating drink, to be “an effusion
of seed.”<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c008'><sup>[273]</sup></a> She also had a symbolism of boiling which I
must place parallel to the especially important alchemistic
vision of Zosimos,<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c008'><sup>[274]</sup></a> who found people in boiling water
within the cavity of the altar.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c008'><sup>[275]</sup></a> This patient used earth
in place of mother, and also water to express mother.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c008'><sup>[276]</sup></a> I
refrain from further examples because future work of the
Zurich School will furnish abundant evidence of this sort.</p>

<p class='c006'>My foregoing proposition of the replacement of the
disturbed function of reality by an archaic surrogate is
supported by an excellent paradox of Spielrein’s. She
says: “I often had the illusion that these patients might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>be simply victims of a folk superstition.” As a matter of
fact, patients substitute phantasies for reality, phantasies
similar to the actually incorrect mental products of the
past, which, however, were once the view of reality. As
the Zosimos vision shows, the old superstitions were symbols<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c008'><sup>[277]</sup></a>
which permitted transitions to the most remote
territory. This must have been very expedient for certain
archaic periods, for by this means convenient bridges
were offered to lead a partial amount of libido over into
the mental realm. Evidently Spielrein thinks of a similar
biological meaning of the symbols when she says:<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c008'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“Thus a symbol seems to me to owe its origin in general to
the tendency of a complex for dissolution in the common totality
of thought.... The complex is robbed by that of the personal
element.... This tendency towards dissolution (transformation)
of every individual complex is the motive for poetry, painting,
for every sort of art.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When here we replace the formal conception “complex”
by the conception of the quantity of libido (the
total effect of the complex), which, from the standpoint of
the libido theory, is a justified measure, then does Spielrein’s
view easily agree with mine. When primitive man
understands in general what an act of generation is, then,
according to the principle of the path of least resistance,
he never can arrive at the idea of replacing the generative
organs by a sword-blade or a shuttle; but this is the case
with certain Indians, who explain the origin of mankind
by the union of the two transference symbols. He then
must be compelled to devise an analogous thing in order to
bring a manifest sexual interest upon an asexual expression.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>The propelling motive of this transition of the
<em>immediate sexual</em> libido to the non-sexual representation
can, in my opinion, be found only in a <em>resistance which
opposes primitive sexuality</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears as if, by this means of phantastic analogy
formation, more libido would gradually become desexualized,
because increasingly more phantasy correlates were
put in the place of the primitive achievement of the sexual
libido. With this an enormous broadening of the world
idea was gradually developed because new objects were
always assimilated as sexual symbols. It is a question
whether the human consciousness has not been brought
to its present state entirely or in great part in this manner.
It is evident, in any case, that an important significance
in the development of the human mind is due to
the impulse towards the discovery of analogy. We must
agree thoroughly with Steinthal when he says that an
absolutely overweening importance must be granted to
the little phrase “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gleich wie</span>” (even as) in the history
of the development of thought. It is easy to believe that
the carryover of the libido to a phantastic correlate has
led primitive man to a number of the most important
discoveries.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE LIBIDO. A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF PRIMITIVE HUMAN DISCOVERIES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the following pages I will endeavor to picture a
concrete example of the transition of the libido. I once
treated a patient who suffered from a depressive catatonic
condition. The case was one of only a slight introversion
psychosis; therefore, the existence of many
hysterical features was not surprising. In the beginning
of the analytic treatment, while telling of a very painful
occurrence she fell into a hysterical-dreamy state, in which
she showed all signs of sexual excitement. For obvious
reasons she lost the knowledge of my presence during this
condition. The excitement led to a masturbative act
(frictio femorum). This act was accompanied by a
peculiar gesture. She made a very <em>violent rotary motion</em>
with the forefinger of the left hand on the left temple,
as if she were boring a hole there. Afterwards there was
complete amnesia for what had happened, and there was
nothing to be learned about the queer gesture with her
hand. Although this act can easily be likened to a boring
into the mouth, nose or ear, now transferred to the
temple, it belongs in the territory of infantile ludus sexualis<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c008'><sup>[279]</sup></a>—to
the preliminary exercise preparatory to sexual
activity. Without really understanding it, this gesture,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>nevertheless, seemed very important to me. Many weeks
later I had an opportunity to speak to the patient’s
mother, and from her I learned that her daughter had
been a very exceptional child. When only two years old
she would sit with her back to an open cupboard door for
hours and rhythmically beat her head against the door<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c008'><sup>[280]</sup></a>—to
the distraction of the household. A little later, instead
of playing as other children, she began to bore a hole with
her finger in the plaster of the wall of the house. She
did this with little turning and scraping movements, and
kept herself busy at this occupation for hours. She was
a complete puzzle to her parents. From her fourth year
she practised onanism. It is evident that in this early
infantile activity the preliminary stage of the later trouble
may be found. The especially remarkable features in this
case are, first, that the child did not carry out the action
on its own body, and, secondly, the assiduity with which
it carried on the action.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c008'><sup>[281]</sup></a> One is tempted to bring these
two facts into a causal relationship and to say, because the
child does not accomplish this action on her own body,
perhaps that is the reason of the assiduity, for by boring
into the wall she never arrives at the same satisfaction as
if she executed the activity onanistically on her own body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very evident onanistic boring of the patient can be
traced back to a very early stage of childhood, which is
prior to the period of local onanism. That time is still
psychologically very obscure, because individual reproductions
and memories are lacking to a great extent, the same
as among animals. The race characteristics (manner of
life) predominate during the entire life of the animal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>whereas among men the individual character asserts itself
over the race type. Granting the correctness of this
remark, we are struck with the apparently wholly incomprehensible
individual activity of this child at this early
age. We learn from her later life history that her development,
which is, as is always the case, intimately interwoven
with parallel external events, has led to that mental
disturbance which is especially well known on account of
its individuality and the originality of its productions, i. e.
dementia præcox. The peculiarity of this disturbance, as
we have pointed out above, depends upon the predominance
of the phantastic form of thought—of the infantile
in general. From this type of thinking proceed all those
numerous contacts with mythological products, and that
which we consider as original and wholly individual creations
are very often creations which are comparable with
nothing but those of antiquity. I believe that this comparison
can be applied to all formations of this remarkable
illness, and perhaps also to this special symptom of
boring. We have already seen that the onanistic boring
of the patient dated from a very early stage of childhood,
that is to say, it was reproduced from that period of the
past. The sick woman fell back for the first time into
the early onanism only after she had been married many
years, and following the death of her child, with whom
she had identified herself through an overindulgent love.
When the child died the still healthy mother was overcome
by early infantile symptoms in the form of scarcely
concealed fits of masturbation, which were associated with
this very act of boring. As already observed, the primary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>boring appeared at a time which preceded the infantile
onanism localized in the genitals. This fact is of significance
in so far as this boring differs thereby from a similar
later practice which appeared after the genital onanism.
The later bad habits represent, as a rule, a substitution
for repressed genital masturbation, or for an attempt in
this direction. As such these habits (finger-sucking, biting
the nails, picking at things, boring into the ears and nose,
etc.) may persist far into adult life as regular symptoms
of a repressed amount of libido.</p>

<p class='c007'>As has already been shown above, the libido in youthful
individuals at first manifests itself in the nutritional
zone, when food is taken in the act of suckling with
rhythmic movements and with every sign of satisfaction.
With the growth of the individual and the development
of his organs the libido creates for itself new avenues to
supply its need of activity and satisfaction. The primary
model of rhythmic activity, producing pleasure and satisfaction,
must now be transferred to the zone of other
functions, with sexuality as its final goal. A considerable
part of the “hunger libido” is transferred into the
“sexual libido.” This transition does not take place suddenly
at the time of puberty, as is generally supposed, but
very gradually in the course of the greater part of childhood.
The libido can free itself only with difficulty and
very slowly from that which is peculiar to the function of
nutrition, in order to enter into the peculiarity of the
sexual function. Two periods are to be distinguished in
this state of transition, so far as I can judge—<em>the epoch of
suckling and the epoch of the displaced rhythmic activity</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Suckling still belongs to the function of nutrition, but
passes beyond it, however, in that it is no longer the function
of nutrition, but rhythmic activity, with pleasure and
satisfaction as a goal, without the taking of nourishment.
Here the hand enters as an auxiliary organ. In the
period of the displaced rhythmic activity the hand appears
still more clearly as an auxiliary organ; the gaining of
pleasure leaves the mouth zone and turns to other regions.
The possibilities are now many. As a rule, other openings
of the body become the objects of the libido interest;
then the skin, and special portions of that. The activity
expressed in these parts, which can appear as rubbing,
boring, picking, and so on, follows a certain rhythm and
serves to produce pleasure. After longer or shorter tarryings
of the libido at these stations, it passes onward until
it reaches the sexual zone, and there, for the first time,
can be occasion for the beginning of onanistic attempts.
In its migration the libido takes more than a little of the
function of nutrition with it into the sexual zone, which
readily accounts for the numerous and innate correlations
between the functions of nutrition and sexuality. If,
after the occupation of the sexual zone, an obstacle arises
against the present form of application of the libido, then
there occurs, according to the well-known laws, a regression
to the nearest station lying behind, to the two above-mentioned
periods. It is now of special importance that
the epoch of the displaced rhythmic activity coincides in
a general way with the time of the development of the
mind and of speech. I might designate the period from
birth until the occupation of the sexual zone as the presexual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>stage of development. This generally occurs between
the third and fifth year, and is comparable to the
chrysalis stage in butterflies. It is distinguished by the
irregular commingling of the elements of nutrition and of
sexual functions. Certain regressions follow directly back
to the presexual stage, and, judging from my experience,
this seems to be the rule in the regression of dementia
præcox. I will give two brief examples. One case concerns
a young girl who developed a catatonic state during
her engagement. When she saw me for the first time, she
came up suddenly, embraced me, and said, “Papa, give
me something to eat.” The other case concerns a young
maidservant who complained that people pursued her
with electricity and that this caused a queer feeling in her
genitals, “as if it ate and drank down there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These regressive phenomena show that even from the
distance of the modern mind those early stages of the
libido can be regressively reached. One may assume,
therefore, that in the earliest states of human development
this road was much more easily travelled than it is
to-day. It becomes then a matter of great interest to
learn whether traces of this have been preserved in
history.</p>

<p class='c007'>We owe our knowledge of the ethnologic phantasy of
boring to the valuable work of Abraham,<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c008'><sup>[282]</sup></a> who also refers
us to the writings of Adalbert Kuhn.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c008'><sup>[283]</sup></a> Through this investigation
we learn that Prometheus, the fire-bringer,
may be a brother of the Hindoo Pramantha, that is to
say, of the masculine fire-rubbing piece of wood. The
Hindoo fire-bringer is called Mâtariçvan, and the activity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of the fire preparation is always designated in the hieratic
text by the verb “manthâmi,”<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c008'><sup>[284]</sup></a> which means <em>shaking</em>,
<em>rubbing</em>, <em>bringing forth by rubbing</em>. Kuhn has put this
verb in connection with the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μανθάνω</span>, which means
“to learn,” and has explained this conceptual relationship.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c008'><sup>[285]</sup></a>
The “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tertium comparationis</span>” might lie in the
rhythm, the movement to and fro in the mind. According
to Kuhn, the root “manth” or “math” must be traced
from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μανθάνω</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάθημα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάθησις</span>) to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προ-μηθέομαι</span> to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Προμηθεύς</span>,<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c008'><sup>[286]</sup></a> who is the Greek fire-robber. Through
an unauthorized Sanskrit word “pramâthyus,” which
comes by way of “pramantha,” and which possesses
the double meaning of “Rubber” and “Robber,”
the transition to Prometheus was effected. With that,
however, the prefix “pra” caused special difficulty,
so that the whole derivation was doubted by a series
of authors, and was held, in part, as erroneous. On
the other hand, it was pointed out that as the Thuric Zeus
bore the especially interesting cognomen <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Προ-μανθεύς</span>,
thus <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Προ-μηθεύς</span> might not be an original Indo-Germanic
stem word that was related to the Sanskrit “pramantha,”
but might represent only a cognomen. This interpretation
is supported by a gloss of Hesychius, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἰθάς</span>: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ τῶν
Τιτάνων κήρυξ Προμηθεύς</span>.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c008'><sup>[287]</sup></a> Another gloss of Hesychius
explains <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰθαίνομαι</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ιαίνω</span>) as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θερμαίνομαι</span>, through which
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἰθάς</span> attains the meaning of “the flaming one,” analogous
to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αἴθων</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Φλεγύας</span>.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c008'><sup>[288]</sup></a> The relation of Prometheus to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>pramantha could scarcely be so direct as Kuhn conjectures.
The question of an indirect relation is not decided
with that. Above all, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Προμηθεύς</span> is of great significance
as a surname for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἰθάς</span>, since the “flaming one” is the
“fore-thinker.” (<em>Pramati</em> = precaution is also an attribute
of Agni, although <em>pramati</em> is of another derivation.)
Prometheus, however, belongs to the line of Phlegians
which was placed by Kuhn in uncontested relationship to
the Indian priest family of Bhṛgu.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c008'><sup>[289]</sup></a> The Bhṛgu are like
Mâtariçvan (the “one swelling in the mother”), also
fire-bringers. Kuhn quotes a passage, according to which
Bhṛgu also arises from the flame like Agni. (“In the
flame Bhṛgu originated. Bhṛgu roasted, but did not
burn.”) This view leads to a root related to Bhṛgu,
that is to say, to the Sanskrit <em>bhrây</em> = to light, Latin
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fulgeo</span></i> and Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φλέγω</span> (Sanskrit <em>bhargas</em> = splendor,
Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fulgur</span></i>). Bhṛgu appears, therefore, as “the shining
one.” <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Φλεγύας</span> means a certain species of eagle, on
account of its burnished gold color. The connection
with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φλέγειν</span>, which signifies “to burn,” is clear. The
Phlegians are also the fire eagles.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c008'><sup>[290]</sup></a> Prometheus also belongs
to the Phlegians. The path from Pramantha to
Prometheus passes not through the word, but through the
idea, and, therefore, we should adopt this same meaning
for Prometheus as that which Pramantha attains from the
Hindoo fire symbolism.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c008'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Pramantha, as the tool of Manthana (the fire
sacrifice), is considered purely sexual in the Hindoo; the
Pramantha as phallus, or man; the bored wood underneath
as vulva, or woman.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c008'><sup>[292]</sup></a> The resulting fire is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>child, the divine son Agni. The two pieces of wood are
called in the cult Purûravas and Urvaçî, and were thought
of personified as man and woman. The fire was born
from the genitals of the woman.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c008'><sup>[293]</sup></a> An especially interesting
representation of fire production, as a religious
ceremony (manthana), is given by Weber:<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c008'><sup>[294]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“A certain sacrificial fire was lit by the rubbing together of
two sticks; one piece of wood is taken up with the words: ‘Thou
art the birthplace of the fire,’ and two blades of grass are placed
upon it; ‘Ye are the two testicles,’ to the ‘adhârarani’ (the
underlying wood): ‘Thou art Urvaçî’; then the utarârani (that
which is placed on top) is anointed with butter. ‘Thou art
Power.’ This is then placed on the adhârarani. ‘Thou art
Purûravas’ and both are rubbed three times. ‘I rub thee with
the Gâyatrîmetrum: I rub thee with the Trishtubhmeṭrum: I rub
thee with the Jagatîmetrum.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sexual symbolism of this fire production is unmistakable.
We see here also the rhythm, the metre in its
original place as sexual rhythm, rising above the mating
call into music. A song of the Rigveda<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c008'><sup>[295]</sup></a> conveys the
same interpretation and symbolism:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here is the gear for function, here tinder made ready for the spark.</div>
      <div class='line'>Bring thou the matron:<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c008'><sup>[296]</sup></a> we will rub Agni in ancient fashion forth.</div>
      <div class='line'>In the two fire-sticks Jâtavedas lieth, even as the well-formed germ in pregnant women;</div>
      <div class='line'>Agni who day by day must be exalted by men who watch and worship with oblations;</div>
      <div class='line'>Lay this with care on that which lies extended: straight hath she borne the steer when made prolific.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>With his red pillar—radiant in his splendor—in our skilled task is born the son of Ilâ.”<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c008'><sup>[297]</sup></a>—<em>Book III.</em> xxix: 1–3.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Side by side with the unequivocal coitus symbolism we
see that the Pramantha is also Agni, the created son.
The Phallus is the son, or the son is the Phallus. Therefore,
Agni in the Vedic mythology has the threefold character.
With this we are once more connected with the
above-mentioned Cabiric Father-Son-Cult. In the modern
German language we have preserved echoes of the primitive
symbols. A boy is designated as “bengel” (short,
thick piece of wood). In Hessian as “stift” or “bolzen”
(arrow,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c008'><sup>[298]</sup></a> wooden peg or stump). The Artemisia
Abrotanum, which is called in German “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Stabwurz</span>”
(stick root), is called in English “Boy’s Love.” (The
vulgar designation of the penis as “boy” was remarked
even by Grimm and others.) The ceremonial production
of fire was retained in Europe as late as the nineteenth
century as a superstitious custom. Kuhn mentions such a
case even in the year 1828, which occurred in Germany.
The solemn, magic ceremony was called the “Nodfyr”—“The
fire of need”<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c008'><sup>[299]</sup></a>—and the charm was chiefly used
against cattle epidemics. Kuhn cites from the chronicle
of Lanercost of the year 1268 an especially noteworthy
case of the “Nodfyr,”<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c008'><sup>[300]</sup></a> the ceremonies of which plainly
reveal the fundamental phallic meaning:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro fidei divinæ integritate servanda recolat lector, quod cum
hoc anno in Laodonia pestis grassaretur in pecudes armenti, quam
vocant usetati Lungessouht, quidam bestiales, habitu claustrales
non animo, docebant idiotas patriæ ignem confrictione de lignis
educere et simulacrum Priapi statuere, et per hæc bestiis succurrere.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Quod cum unus laicus Cisterciensis apud Fentone fecisset
ante atrium aulæ, ac intinctis testiculis canis in aquam benedictam
super animalis sparsisset, etc.</span>”<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c008'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>These examples, which allow us to recognize a clear
sexual symbolism in the generation of fire, prove, therefore,
since they originate from different times and different
peoples, the existence of a universal tendency to credit
to fire production not only a magical but also a sexual
significance. This ceremonial or magic repetition of this
very ancient, long-outlived observance shows how insistently
the human mind clings to the old forms, and how
deeply rooted is this very ancient reminiscence of fire
boring. One might almost be inclined to see in the sexual
symbolism of fire production a relatively late addition to
the priestly lore. This may, indeed, be true for the ceremonial
elaboration of the fire mysteries, but whether
originally the generation of fire was in general a sexual
action, that is to say, a “coitus-play,” is still a question.
That similar things occur among very primitive
people we learn from the Australian tribe of the Watschandies,<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c008'><sup>[302]</sup></a>
who in the spring perform the following
magic ceremonies of fertilization: They dig a hole in
the ground, so formed and surrounded with bushes as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>counterfeit a woman’s genitals. They dance the night
long around this hole; in connection with this they hold
spears in front of themselves in a manner to recall the
penis in erection. They dance around the hole and thrust
their spears into the ditch, while they cry to it, “Pulli
nira, pulli nira, <em class='gesperrt'>wataka</em>!” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non fossa, non fossa, sed
cunnus!</span>) Such obscene dances appear among other primitive
races as well.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c008'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In this spring incantation are contained the elements
of the coitus play.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c008'><sup>[304]</sup></a> This play is nothing but a coitus
game, that is to say, originally this play was simply a
coitus in the form of sacramental mating, which for a
long time was a mysterious element among certain cults,
and reappeared in sects.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c008'><sup>[305]</sup></a> In the ceremonies of Zinzendorf’s
followers echoes of the coitus sacrament may be
recognized; also in other sects.</p>

<p class='c007'>One can easily think that just as the above-mentioned
Australian bushmen perform the coitus play in this manner
the same performance could be enacted in another
manner, and, indeed, in the form of fire production. Instead
of through two selected human beings, the coitus
was represented by two substitutes, by Purûravas and
Urvaçi, by Phallus and Vulva, by borer and opening.
Just as the primitive thought behind other customs is
really the sacramental coition so here the primal tendency
is really the act itself. For the act of fertilization is the
climax—the true festival of life, and well worthy to become
the nucleus of a religious mystery. If we are justified
in concluding that the symbolism of the hole in the
earth used by the Watschandies for the fertilization of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the earth takes the place of the coitus, then the generation
of fire could be considered in the same way as a
substitute for coitus; and, indeed, it might be further concluded
as a consequence of this reasoning that the invention
of fire-making is also due to the need of supplying a
symbol for the sexual act.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c008'><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Let us return, for a moment, to the infantile symptom
of boring. Let us imagine a strong adult man carrying
on the boring with two pieces of wood with the same perseverance
and the energy corresponding to that of this
child. He may very easily create fire by this play. But
of greatest significance in this work is the rhythm.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c008'><sup>[307]</sup></a> This
hypothesis seems to me psychologically possible, although
it should not be said with this that only in this way could
the discovery of fire occur. It can result just as well by
the striking together of flints. It is scarcely possible that
fire was created in only one way. All I want to establish
here is merely the psychologic process, the symbolic indications
of which point to the possibility that in such a
way was fire invented or prepared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The existence of the primitive coitus play or rite seems
to me sufficiently proven. The only thing that is obscure
is the energy and emphasis of the ritual play. It is well
known that those primitive rites were often of very bloody
seriousness, and were performed with an extraordinary
display of energy, which appears as a great contrast to
the well-known indolence of primitive humanity. Therefore,
the ritual activity entirely loses the character of play,
and wins that of purposeful effort. If certain Negro
races can dance the whole night long to three tones in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the most monotonous manner, then, according to our idea,
there is in this an absolute lack of the character of play
pastime; it approaches nearer to exercise. There seems
to exist a sort of compulsion to transfer the libido into
such ritual activity. If the basis of the ritual activity is
the sexual act, we may assume that it is really the underlying
thought and object of the exercise. Under these
circumstances, the question arises why the primitive man
endeavors to represent the sexual act symbolically and
with effort, or, if this wording appears to be too hypothetical,
why does he exert energy to such a degree only
to accomplish practically useless things, which apparently
do not especially amuse him?<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c008'><sup>[308]</sup></a> It may be assumed that
the sexual act is more desirable to primitive man than
such absurd and, moreover, fatiguing exercises. It is
hardly possible but that a certain compulsion conducts the
energy away from the original object and real purpose,
inducing the production of surrogates. The existence of
a phallic or orgiastic cult does not indicate <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo ipso</span></i> a particularly
lascivious life any more than the ascetic symbolism
of Christianity means an especially moral life.
One honors that which one does not possess or that which
one is not. This compulsion, to speak in the nomenclature
formulated above, removes a certain amount of libido
from the real sexual activity, and creates a symbolic and
practically valid substitute for what is lost. This psychology
is confirmed by the above-mentioned Watschandie
ceremony; during the entire ceremony none of the men
may look at a woman. This detail again informs us
from whence the libido is to be diverted. But this gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>rise to the pressing question, Whence comes this compulsion?
We have already suggested above that the primitive
sexuality encounters a resistance which leads to a
side-tracking of the libido on to substitution actions
(analogy, symbolism, etc.). It is unthinkable that it is a
question of any outer opposition whatsoever, or of a real
obstacle, since it occurs to no savage to catch his elusive
quarry with ritual charms; but it is a question of an internal
resistance; will opposes will; libido opposes libido,
since a psychologic resistance as an energic phenomenon
corresponds to a certain amount of libido. The psychologic
compulsion for the transformation of the libido is
based on an original division of the will. I will return
to this primal splitting of the libido in another place.
Here let us concern ourselves only with the problem of
the transition of the libido. The transition takes place,
as has been repeatedly suggested by means of shifting to
an analogy. The libido is taken away from its proper
place and transferred to another substratum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The resistance against sexuality aims, therefore, at
preventing the sexual act; it also seeks to crowd the libido
away from the sexual function. We see, for example, in
hysteria, how the specific repression blocks the real path
of transference; therefore, the libido is obliged to take
another path, and that an earlier one, namely, the incestuous
road which ultimately leads to the parents. Let
us speak, however, of the incest prohibition, which hindered
the very first sexual transference. Then the situation
changes in so far that no earlier way of transference
is left, except that of the presexual stage of development,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>where the libido was still partly in the function of nutrition.
By a regression to the presexual material the libido
becomes quasi-desexualized. But as the incest prohibition
signifies only a temporary and conditional restriction of
the sexuality, thus only that part of the libido which is
best designated as the incestuous component is now
pushed back to the presexual stage. The repression,
therefore, concerns only that part of the sexual libido
which wishes to fix itself permanently upon the parents.
The sexual libido is only withdrawn from the incestuous
component, repressed upon the presexual stage, and
there, if the operation is successful, desexualized, by
which this amount of libido is prepared for an asexual
application. However, it is to be assumed that this operation
is accomplished only with difficulty, because the
incestuous libido, so to speak, must be artificially separated
from the sexual libido, with which, for ages, through
the whole animal kingdom, it was indistinguishably united.
The regression of the incestuous component must, therefore,
take place, not only with great difficulty, but also
carry with it into the presexual stage a considerable
sexual character. The consequence of this is that the resulting
phenomena, although stamped with the character
of the sexual act, are, nevertheless, not really sexual acts
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i>; they are derived from the presexual stage, and
are maintained by the repressed sexual libido, therefore
possess a double significance. Thus the fire boring is a
coitus (and, to be sure, an incestuous one), but a desexualized
one, which has lost its immediate sexual worth, and
is, therefore, indirectly useful to the propagation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>species. The presexual stage is characterized by countless
possibilities of application, because the libido has not
yet formed definite localizations. It therefore appears
intelligible that an amount of libido which reaches this
stage through regression is confronted with manifold possibilities
of application. Above all, it is met with the
possibility of a purely onanistic activity. But as the matter
in question in the regressive component of libido is
sexual libido, the ultimate object of which is propagation,
therefore it goes to the external object (Parents); it will
also introvert with this destination as its essential character.
The result, therefore, is that the purely onanistic
activity turns out to be insufficient, and another object
must be sought for, which takes the place of the incest
object. The nurturing mother earth represents the ideal
example of such an object. The psychology of the presexual
stage contributes the nutrition component; the
sexual libido the coitus idea. From this the ancient symbols
of agriculture arise. In the work of agriculture
hunger and incest intermingle. The ancient cults of
mother earth and all the superstitions founded thereon
saw in the cultivation of the earth the fertilization of the
mother. The aim of the action is desexualized, however,
for it is the fruit of the field and the nourishment contained
therein. The regression resulting from the incest
prohibition leads, in this case, to the new valuation of the
mother; this time, however, not as a sexual object, but
as a nourisher.</p>

<p class='c007'>The discovery of fire seems to be due to a very similar
regression to the presexual stage, more particularly to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>nearest stage of the displaced rhythmic manifestation.
The libido, introverted from the incest prohibition (with
the more detailed designation of the motor components
of coitus), when it reaches the presexual stage, meets
the related infantile boring, to which it now gives, in accordance
with its realistic destination, an actual material.
(Therefore the material is fittingly called “materia,”
as the object is the mother as above.) As I sought to
show above, the action of the infantile boring requires
only the strength and perseverance of an adult man and
suitable “material” in order to generate fire. If this is
so, it may be expected that analogous to our foregoing
case of onanistic boring the generation of fire originally
occurred as such an act of quasi-onanistic activity, objectively
expressed. The demonstration of this can never
be actually furnished, but it is thinkable that somewhere
traces of this original onanistic preliminary exercise of
fire production have been preserved. I have succeeded in
finding a passage in a very old monument of Hindoo
literature which contains this transition of the sexual
libido through the onanistic phase in the preparation of
fire. This passage is found in Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad:<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c008'><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“In truth, he (Âtman)<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c008'><sup>[310]</sup></a> was as large as a woman and a man,
when they embrace each other. This, his own self, he divided
into two parts, out of which husband and wife were formed.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c008'><sup>[311]</sup></a>
With her, he copulated; from this humanity sprang. She, however,
pondered: ‘How may he unite with me after he has created
me from himself? Now I shall hide!’ Then she became a cow;
he, however, became a bull and mated with her. From that
sprang the horned cattle. Then she became a mare; he, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>became a stallion; she became a she-ass; he, an ass, and mated with
her. From these sprang the whole-hoofed animals. She became
a goat; he became a buck; she became an ewe; he became a ram,
and mated with her. Thus were created goats and sheep. Thus
it happened that all that mates, even down to the ants, he created—then
he perceived: ‘Truly I myself am Creation, for I have
created the whole world!’ Thereupon he rubbed his hands (held
before the mouth) so that he brought forth fire from his mouth,
as from the mother womb, and from his hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We meet here a peculiar myth of creation which requires
a psychologic interpretation. In the beginning the
libido was undifferentiated and bisexual;<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c008'><sup>[312]</sup></a> this was followed
by differentiation into a male and a female component.
From then on man knows what he is. Now
follows a gap in the coherence of the thought where
belongs that very resistance which we have postulated
above for the explanation of the urge for sublimation.
Next follows the onanistic act of rubbing or boring (here
finger-sucking) transferred from the sexual zone, from
which proceeds the production of fire.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c008'><sup>[313]</sup></a> The libido here
leaves its characteristic manifestation as sexual function
and regresses to the presexual stage, where, in conformity
with the above explanation, it occupies one of the preliminary
stages of sexuality, thereby producing, in the
view expressed in the Upanishad, the first human art,
and from there, as suggested by Kuhn’s idea of the root
“manth,” perhaps the higher intellectual activity in general.
This course of development is not strange to the
psychiatrist, for it is a well-known psychopathological fact
that onanism and excessive activity of phantasy are very
closely related. (The sexualizing-autonomizing of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>mind through autoerotism<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c008'><sup>[314]</sup></a> is so familiar a fact that
examples of that are superfluous.) The course of the
libido, as we may conclude from these studies, originally
proceeded in a similar manner as in the child, only in a
reversed sequence. The sexual act was pushed out of its
proper zone and was transferred into the analogous
mouth zone<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c008'><sup>[315]</sup></a>—the mouth receiving the significance of the
female genitals; the hand and the fingers, respectively, receiving
the phallic meaning.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c008'><sup>[316]</sup></a> In this manner the regressively
reoccupied activity of the presexual stage is invested
with the sexual significance, which, indeed, it already
possessed, in part, before, but in a wholly different sense.
Certain functions of the presexual stage are found to be
permanently suitable, and, therefore, are retained later
on as sexual functions. Thus, for example, the mouth
zone is retained as of erotic importance, meaning that its
valuation is permanently fixed. Concerning the mouth,
we know that it also has a sexual meaning among animals,
inasmuch as, for example, stallions bite mares in the sexual
act; also, cats, cocks, etc. A second significance of the
mouth is as an instrument of speech, it serves essentially
in the production of the mating call, which mostly represents
the developed tones of the animal kingdom. As to
the hand, we know that it has the important significance
of the contrectation organ (for example, among frogs).
The frequent erotic use of the hand among monkeys is
well known. If there exists a resistance against the real
sexuality, then the accumulated libido is most likely to
cause a hyperfunction of those collaterals which are most
adapted to compensate for the resistance, that is to say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the nearest functions which serve for the introduction of
the act;<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c008'><sup>[317]</sup></a> on one side the function of the hand, on the
other that of the mouth. The sexual act, however, against
which the opposition is directed is replaced by a similar
act of the presexual stage, the classic case being either
finger-sucking or boring. Just as among apes the foot
can on occasions take the place of the hand, so the child
is often uncertain in the choice of the object to suck, and
puts the big toe in the mouth instead of the finger. This
last movement belongs to a Hindoo rite, only the big toe
was not put in the mouth, but held against the eye.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c008'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
Through the sexual significance of the hand and mouth
these organs, which in the presexual stage served to obtain
pleasure, are invested with a procreating power
which is identical with the above-mentioned destination,
which aims at the external object, because it concerns the
sexual or creating libido. When, through the actual
preparation of fire, the sexual character of the libido employed
in that is fulfilled, then the mouth zone remains
without adequate expression; only the hand has now
reached its real, purely human goal in its first art.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mouth has, as we saw, a further important function,
which has just as much sexual relation to the object
as the hand, that is to say, the production of the mating
call. In opening up the autoerotic ring (hand-mouth),<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c008'><sup>[319]</sup></a>
where the phallic hand became the fire-producing tool,
the libido which was directed to the mouth zone was
obliged to seek another path of functioning, which naturally
was found in the already existing love call. The
excess of libido entering here must have had the usual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>results, namely, the stimulation of the newly possessed
function; hence an elaboration of the mating call.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know that from the primitive sounds human speech
has developed. Corresponding to the psychological situation,
it might be assumed that language owes its real
origin to this moment, when the impulse, repressed into
the presexual stage, turns to the external in order to find
an equivalent object there. The real thought as a conscious
activity is, as we saw in the first part of this book,
a thinking with positive determination towards the external
world, that is to say, a “speech thinking.” This
sort of thinking seems to have originated at that moment.
It is very remarkable that this view, which was won by
the path of reasoning, is again supported by old tradition
and other mythological fragments.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Aitareyopanishad<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c008'><sup>[320]</sup></a> the following quotation is to
be found in the doctrine of the development of man:
“Being brooded-o’er, his mouth hatched out, like as an
egg; from out his mouth (came) speech, from speech, the
fire.” In Part II, where it is depicted how the newly
created objects entered man, it reads: “Fire, speech becoming,
entered in the mouth.” These quotations allow
us to plainly recognize the intimate connection between
fire and speech.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c008'><sup>[321]</sup></a> In Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad is to be
found this passage:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Yayñavalkya,’ thus he spake, ‘when after the death of this
man his speech entereth the fire, his breath into the wind, his eye
into the sun, etc.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>A further quotation from the Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad
reads:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“But when the sun is set, O Yayñavalkya, and the moon has
set, and the fire is extinguished, what then serves man as light?
Then speech serves him as light; then, by the light of speech
he sits, and moves, he carries on his work, and he returns home.
But when the sun is set, O Yayñavalkya, and the moon is set,
and the fire extinguished, and the voice is dumb, what then serves
man as light? Then he serves himself (Atman) as light; then,
by the light of himself, he sits and moves, carries on his work
and returns home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In this passage we notice that fire again stands in the
closest relation to speech. Speech itself is called a
“light,” which, in its turn, is reduced to the “light” of
the Atman, the creating psychic force, the libido. Thus
the Hindoo metapsychology conceives speech and fire
as emanations of the inner light from which we know
that it is libido. Speech and fire are its forms of manifestation,
the first human arts, which have resulted from
its transformation. This common psychologic origin
seems also to be indicated by certain results of philology.
The Indo-Germanic root <em>bhâ</em> designates the idea of “to
lighten, to shine.” This root is found in Greek, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάω</span>,

<p class='c007'>The root <em>lâ</em>, with the meaning of “to make sound, to

<p class='c007'>The related root <em>lesô</em>, with the meaning “desire,” is

found in <em>las</em>, <em>lásati</em> = to radiate, to shine.</p>

<p class='c007'>This group unites, as is evident, the meanings of “to
desire, to play, to radiate, and to sound.” A similar
archaic confluence of meanings in the primal libido symbolism
(as we are perhaps justified in calling it) is found
in that class of Egyptian words which are derived from
the closely related roots <em>ben</em> and <em>bel</em> and the reduplication
<em>benben</em> and <em>belbel</em>. The original significance of these
roots is “to burst forth, to emerge, to extrude, to well
out,” with the associated idea of bubbling, boiling and
roundness. <em>Belbel</em>, accompanied by the sign of the obelisk,
of originally phallic nature, means source of light.
The obelisk itself had besides the names of <em>techenu</em> and
<em>men</em> also the name <em>benben</em>, more rarely <em>berber</em> and
<em>belbel</em>.<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c008'><sup>[324]</sup></a> The libido symbolism makes clear this connection,
it seems to me.</p>

of “to lighten, to glow,” is found in Sanskrit <em>ulkă</em> =
firebrand, Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ϝελχᾶνος</span> = Vulcan. This same root
<em>vel</em> means also “to sound”; in Sanskrit <em>vâní</em> = tone, song,
music. Tschech <i><span lang="cs" xml:lang="cs">volati</span></i> = to call.</p>

<p class='c007'>The root <em>svénô</em> = to sound, to ring, is found in Sanskrit

<p class='c007'>The idea of the Sanskrit <em>têjas</em> suggests the fundamental
significance of the libido for the conception of the world
in general. I am indebted to Dr. Abegg, in Zurich, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>thorough Sanskrit scholar, for the compilation of the
eight meanings of this word.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Têjas</em> signifies:</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Sharpness, cutting edge.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Fire, splendor, light, glow, heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sanskrit word for fire is <em>agnis</em> (the Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis</span></i>);<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c008'><sup>[327]</sup></a>
the fire personified is the god Agni, the divine mediator,<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c008'><sup>[328]</sup></a>
whose symbol has certain points of contact with that of
Christ. In Avesta and in the Vedas the fire is the messenger
of the gods. In the Christian mythology certain
parts are closely related with the myth of Agni. Daniel
speaks of the three men in the fiery furnace:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then Nebuchadnezar, the King, was astonished, and rose
up in haste and spake, and said unto his counsellors: ‘Did not
we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“They answered and said: ‘True, O King!’</p>

<p class='c017'>“He answered and said: ‘Lo, I see four men loose, walking
in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of
the fourth is like the Son of God.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to that the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Biblia pauperum</span>” observes
(according to an old German incunabulum of 1471):</p>

<p class='c017'>“One reads in the third chapter of the prophet Daniel that
Nebuchadnezar, the King, caused three men to be placed in a
glowing furnace and that the king often went there, looked in,
and that he saw with the three, a fourth, who was like the Son
of God. The three signify for us, the Holy Trinity and the
fourth, the unity of the being. Christ, too, in His explanation
designated the person of the Trinity and the unity of the being.”</p>

<p class='c007'>According to this mystic interpretation, the legend of
the three men in the fiery furnace appears as a magic
fire ceremony by means of which the Son of God reveals
himself. The Trinity is brought together with the unity,
or, in other words, through coitus a child is produced.
The glowing furnace (like the glowing tripod in
“Faust”) is a mother symbol, where the children are
produced.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c008'><sup>[329]</sup></a> The fourth in the fiery furnace appears as
Christ, the Son of God, who has become a visible God
in the fire. The mystic trinity and unity are sexual symbols.
(Compare with that the many references in Inman:
“Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism.”) It
is said of the Saviour of Israel (the Messiah) and of his
enemies, <cite>Isaiah</cite> x:17:</p>

<p class='c017'>“And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
for a flame.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a hymn of the Syrian Ephrem it is said of Christ:
“Thou who art all fire, have mercy upon me.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Agni is the sacrificial flame, the sacrificer, and the sacrificed,
as Christ himself. Just as Christ left behind his
redeeming blood, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάρμακον ἀθανασίας</span>,<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c008'><sup>[330]</sup></a> in the stimulating
wine, so Agni is the Soma, the holy drink of inspiration,
the mead of immortality.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c008'><sup>[331]</sup></a> Soma and Fire
are entirely identical in Hindoo literature, so that in
Soma we easily rediscover the libido symbol, through
which a series of apparently paradoxical qualities of the
Soma are immediately explained. As the old Hindoos
recognized in fire an emanation of the inner libido fire,
so too they recognized, in the intoxicating drink (Firewater,
Soma-Agni, as rain and fire), an emanation of
libido. The Vedic definition of Soma as seminal fluid
confirms this interpretation.<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c008'><sup>[332]</sup></a> The Soma significance of
fire, similar to the significance of the body of Christ in the
Last Supper (compare the Passover lamb of the Jews,
baked in the form of a cross), is explained by the psychology
of the presexual stage, where the libido was still
in part the function of nutrition. The “Soma” is the
“nourishing drink,” the mythological characterization of
which runs parallel to fire in its origin; therefore, both are
united in Agni. The drink of immortality was stirred by
the Hindoo gods like fire. Through the retreat of the
libido into the presexual stage it becomes clear why so
many gods were either defined sexually or were devoured.</p>

<p class='c007'>As was shown by our discussion of fire preparation, the
fire tool did not receive its sexual significance as a later
addition, but the sexual libido was the motor power which
led to its discovery, so that the later teachings of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>priests were nothing but confirmations of its actual origin.
Other primitive discoveries probably have acquired their
sexual symbolism in the same manner, being also derived
from the sexual libido.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the previous statements, which were based on the
Pramantha of the Agni sacrifice, we have concerned ourselves
only with one significance of the word manthâmi
or mathnâmi, that is to say, with that which expresses
the movement of rubbing. As Kuhn shows, however, this
word also possesses the meaning of tearing off, taking
away by violence, robbing.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c008'><sup>[333]</sup></a> As Kuhn points out, this
significance is already extant in the Vedic text. The
legend of its discovery always expresses the production of
fire as a robbery. (In this far it belongs to the motive
widely spread over the earth of the treasure difficult to
attain.) The fact that in many places and not alone in
India the preparation of fire is represented as having its
origin in robbery, seems to point to a widely spread
thought, according to which the preparation of fire was
something forbidden, something usurped or criminal,
which could be obtained only through stratagem or deeds
of violence (mostly through stratagem).<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c008'><sup>[334]</sup></a> When onanism
confronts the physician as a symptom it does so frequently
under the symbol of secret pilfering, or crafty
imposition, which always signifies the concealed fulfilment
of a forbidden wish.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c008'><sup>[335]</sup></a> Historically, this train of
thought probably implies that the ritual preparation of
fire was employed with a magic purpose, and, therefore,
was pursued by official religions; then it became a ritual
mystery,<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c008'><sup>[336]</sup></a> guarded by the priests and surrounded with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>secrecy. The ritual laws of the Hindoos threaten with
severe punishment him who prepares fire in an incorrect
manner. The fact alone that something is mysterious
means the same as something done in concealment; that
which must remain secret, which one may not see nor do;
also something which is surrounded by severe punishment
of body and soul; therefore, presumably, <em>something
forbidden</em> which has received a license as a religious rite.
After all has been said about the genesis of the preparation
of fire, it is no longer difficult to guess what is the
forbidden thing; <em>it is onanism</em>. When I stated before
that it might be lack of satisfaction which breaks up the
autoerotic ring of the displaced sexual activity transferred
to the body itself, and thus opens wider fields of culture,
I did not mention that this loosely closed ring of the displaced
onanistic activity could be much more firmly closed,
when man makes the other great discovery, that of true
onanism.<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c008'><sup>[337]</sup></a> With that the activity is started in the proper
place, and this, under certain circumstances, may mean a
satisfaction sufficient for a long time, but at the expense
of cheating sexuality of its real purpose. It is a fraud
upon the natural development of things, because all the
dynamic forces which can and should serve the development
of culture are withdrawn from it through onanism,
since, instead of the displacement, a regression to the local
sexual takes place, which is precisely the opposite of that
which is desirable. Psychologically, however, onanism is
a discovery of a significance not to be undervalued. One
is protected from fate, since no sexual need then has the
power to give one up to life. For with onanism one has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the greatest magic in one’s hands; one needs only to
phantasy, and with that to masturbate, then one possesses
all the pleasure of the world, and is no longer compelled
to conquer the world of one’s desires through hard labor
and wrestling with reality.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c008'><sup>[338]</sup></a> Aladdin rubs his lamp and
the obedient genii stand at his bidding; thus the fairy tale
expresses the great psychologic advantage of the easy regression
to the local sexual satisfaction. Aladdin’s symbol
subtly confirms the ambiguity of the magic fire
preparation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The close relation of the generation of fire to the onanistic
act is illustrated by a case, the knowledge of which I
owe to Dr. Schmid, in Cery, that of an imbecile peasant
youth who set many incendiary fires. At one of these
conflagrations he drew suspicion to himself by his behavior.
He stood with his hands in his trouser pockets
in the door of an opposite house and gazed with apparent
delight at the fire. Under examination in the insane
asylum, he described the fire in great detail, and made
suspicious movements in his trouser pockets with his
hands. The physical examination undertaken at once
showed that he had masturbated. Later he confessed
that he had masturbated at the time when he had enjoyed
the fire which he had enkindled himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The preparation of fire in itself is a perfectly ordinary
useful custom, employed everywhere for many centuries,
which in itself involved nothing more mysterious than
eating and drinking. However, there was always a tendency
from time to time to prepare fire in a ceremonious
and mysterious manner (exactly as with ritual eating and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>drinking), which was to be carried out in an exactly prescribed
way and from which no one dared differ. This
mysterious tendency associated with the technique is the
second path in the onanistic regression, always present
by the side of culture. The strict rules applied to it,
the zeal of the ceremonial preparations and the religious
awe of the mysteries next originate from this source;
the ceremonial, although apparently irrational, is an extremely
ingenious institution from the psychologic standpoint,
for it represents a substitute for the possibility of
onanistic regression accurately circumscribed by law.
The law cannot apply to the content of the ceremony, for
it is really quite indifferent for the ritual act, whether it
is carried out in this way or in that way. On the contrary,
it is very essential whether the restrained libido is
discharged through a sterile onanism or transposed into
the path of sublimation. These severe measures of protection
apply primarily to onanism.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c008'><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I am indebted to Freud for a further important reference
to the onanistic nature of the fire theft, or rather
the motive of <em>the treasure difficult of attainment</em> (to
which fire theft belongs). Mythology contains repeated
formulas which read approximately as follows: The
treasure must be plucked or torn off from a taboo tree
(Paradise tree, Hesperides); this is a forbidden and dangerous
act. The clearest example of this is the old barbaric
custom in the service of Diana of Aricia: only he
can become a priest of the goddess who, in her sacred
grove, dares to tear off (“abzureissen”) a bough. The
tearing off has been retained in vulgar speech (besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“abreiben,” rubbing) as a symbol of the act of onanism.
Thus “reiben,” to rub, is like “reissen,” to break off,
both of which are contained in manthami and united
apparently only through the myth of the fire theft bound
up in the act of onanism in a deeper stratum wherein
“reiben,” properly speaking, “reissen,” is employed, but
in a transferred sense. Therefore, it might perhaps be
anticipated that in the deepest stratum, namely, the incestuous,
which precedes the autoerotic stage,<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c008'><sup>[340]</sup></a> the two
meanings coincide, which, through lack of mythological
tradition, can perhaps be traced through etymology only.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE UNCONSCIOUS ORIGIN OF THE HERO</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Prepared by the previous chapters, we approach the
personification of the libido in the form of a conqueror,
a hero or a demon. With this, symbolism leaves the impersonal
and neuter realm, which characterizes the astral
and meteorologic symbol, and takes human form: the
figure of a being changing from sorrow to joy, from joy
to sorrow, and which, like the sun, sometimes stands in
its zenith, sometimes is plunged in darkest night, and
arises from this very night to new splendor.<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c008'><sup>[341]</sup></a> Just as the
sun, guided by its own internal laws, ascends from morn
till noon, and passing beyond the noon descends towards
evening, leaving behind its splendor, and then sinks completely
into the all-enveloping night, thus, too, does mankind
follow his course according to immutable laws, and
also sinks, after his course is completed, into night, in
order to rise again in the morning to a new cycle in his
children. The symbolic transition from sun to man is
easy and practicable. The third and last creation of
Miss Miller’s also takes this course. She calls this piece
“Chiwantopel,” a “hypnagogic poem.” She gives us the
following information about the circumstances surrounding
the origin of this phantasy:</p>

<p class='c017'>“After an evening of care and anxiety, I lay down to sleep
at about half past eleven. I felt excited and unable to sleep,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>although I was very tired. There was no light in the room. I
closed my eyes, and then I had the feeling that something was
about to happen. The sensation of a general relaxation came
over me, and I remained as passive as possible. Lines appeared
before my eyes,—sparks and shining spirals, followed by a kaleidoscopic
review of recent trivial occurrences.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader will regret with me that we cannot know
the reason for her cares and anxieties. It would have
been of great importance for what follows to have information
on this point. This gap in our knowledge is the
more to be deplored because, between the first poem in
1898 and the time of the phantasy here discussed (1902),
four whole years have passed. All information is lacking
regarding this period, during which the great problem
surely survived in the unconscious. Perhaps this lack has
its advantages in that our interest is not diverted from
the universal applicability of the phantasy here produced
by sympathy in regard to the personal fate of the author.
Therefore, something is obviated which often prevents
the analyst in his daily task from looking away from the
tedious toil of detail to that wider relation which reveals
each neurotic conflict to be involved with human fate as a
whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>The condition depicted by the author here corresponds
to such a one as usually precedes an intentional somnambulism<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c008'><sup>[342]</sup></a>
often described by spiritualistic mediums. A certain
inclination to listen to these low nocturnal voices
must be assumed; otherwise such fine and hardly perceptible
inner experiences pass unnoticed. We recognize
in this listening a current of the libido leading inward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>and beginning to flow towards a still invisible, mysterious
goal. It seems that the libido has suddenly discovered an
object in the depths of the unconscious which powerfully
attracts it. The life of man, turned wholly to the external
by nature, does not ordinarily permit such introversion;
there must, therefore, be surmised a certain exceptional
condition, that is to say, a lack of external objects, which
compels the individual to seek a substitute for them in his
own soul. It is, however, difficult to imagine that this
rich world has become too poor to offer an object for
the love of human atoms; nor can the world and its
objects be held accountable for this lack. It offers boundless
opportunities for every one. It is rather the <em>incapacity
to love which robs mankind of his possibilities</em>.
This world is empty to him alone who does not understand
how to direct his libido towards objects, and to
render them alive and beautiful for himself, for Beauty
does not indeed lie in things, but in the feeling that we
give to them. That which compels us to create a substitute
for ourselves is not the external lack of objects,
but our incapacity to lovingly include a thing outside of
ourselves. Certainly the difficulties of the conditions of
life and the adversities of the struggle for existence may
oppress us, yet even adverse external situations would not
hinder the giving out of the libido; on the contrary, they
may spur us on to the greatest exertions, whereby we
bring our whole libido into reality. Real difficulties alone
will never be able to force the libido back permanently
to such a degree as to give rise, for example, to a neurosis.
<em>The conflict, which is the condition of every neurosis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>is lacking.</em> The resistance, which opposes its unwillingness
to the will, alone has the power to produce
that pathogenic introversion which is the starting point of
every psychogenic disturbance. The resistance against
loving produces the inability to love. Just as the normal
libido is comparable to a steady stream which pours its
waters broadly into the world of reality, so the resistance,
dynamically considered, is comparable, not so much to a
rock rearing up in the river bed which is flooded over
or surrounded by the stream, as to a backward flow
towards the source. A part of the soul desires the outer
object; another part, however, harks back to the subjective
world, where the airy and fragile palaces of
phantasy beckon. One can assume the dualism of the
human will for which Bleuler, from the psychiatric point
of view, has coined the word “ambitendency”<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c008'><sup>[343]</sup></a> as something
generally present, bearing in mind that even
the most primitive motor impulse is in opposition; as,
for example, in the act of extension, the flexor muscles
also become innervated. This normal ambitendency,
however, never leads to an inhibition or prevention of the
intended act, but is the indispensable preliminary requirement
for its perfection and coördination. For a resistance
disturbing to this act to arise from this harmony of
finely attuned opposition an abnormal plus or minus
would be needed on one or the other side. The resistance
originates from this added third.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c008'><sup>[344]</sup></a> This applies also
to the duality of the will, from which so many difficulties
arise for mankind. The abnormal third frees the pair
of opposites, which are normally most intimately united,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>and causes their manifestation in the form of separate
tendencies; it is only thus that they become willingness
and unwillingness, which interfere with each other. The
Bhagavad-Gîtâ says, “Be thou free of the pairs of
opposites.”<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c008'><sup>[345]</sup></a> The harmony thus becomes disharmony.
It cannot be my task here to investigate whence the unknown
third arises, and what it is. Taken at the roots
in the case of our patients, the “nuclear complex”
(Freud) reveals itself as the <em>incest problem</em>. The sexual
libido regressing to the parents appears as the incest tendency.
The reason this path is so easily travelled is due
to the enormous indolence of mankind, which will relinquish
no object of the past, but will hold it fast forever.
The “sacrilegious backward grasp” of which Nietzsche
speaks reveals itself, stripped of its incest covering,
as an original passive arrest of the libido in its first object
of childhood. This indolence is also a passion, as La
Rochefoucauld<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c008'><sup>[346]</sup></a> has brilliantly expressed it:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Of all passions, that which is least known to ourselves is
indolence: it is the most ardent and malignant of them all, although
its violence may be insensible, and the injuries it causes
may be hidden; if we will consider its power attentively, we will
see that it makes itself, upon all occasions, mistress of our sentiments,
of our interests, and of our pleasures; it is the anchor,
which has the power to arrest the largest vessels; it is a calm more
dangerous to the most important affairs than rocks and the worst
tempest. The repose of indolence is a secret charm of the soul
which suddenly stops the most ardent pursuits and the firmest
resolutions; finally to give the true idea of this passion, one
must say that indolence is like a beatitude of the soul which
consoles it for all its losses and takes the place of all its possessions.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>This dangerous passion, belonging above all others to
primitive man, appears under the hazardous mask of the
incest symbol, from which the incest fear must drive us
away, and which must be conquered, in the first place,
under the image of the “terrible mother.”<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c008'><sup>[347]</sup></a> It is the
mother of innumerable evils, not the least of which are
neurotic troubles. For, especially from the fogs of the
arrested remnants of the libido, arise the harmful phantasmagoria
which so veil reality that adaptation becomes
almost impossible. However, we will not investigate any
further in this place the foundations of the incest phantasies.
The preliminary suggestion of my purely psychologic
conception of the incest problem may suffice. We
are here only concerned with the question whether <em>resistance</em>
which leads to introversion in our author signifies
a conscious external difficulty or not. If it were an external
difficulty, then, indeed, the libido would be violently
dammed back, and would produce a flood of phantasies,
which can best be designated as schemes, that is to say,
plans as to how the obstacles could be overcome. They
would be very concrete ideas of reality which seek to pave
the way for solutions. It would be a strenuous meditation,
indeed, which would be more likely to lead to anything
rather than to a hypnagogic poem. The passive
condition depicted above in no way fits in with a real external
obstacle, but, precisely through its passive submission,
it indicates a tendency which doubtless scorns real
solutions and prefers phantastic substitutes. Ultimately
and essentially we are, therefore, dealing with an internal
conflict, perhaps after the manner of those earlier conflicts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>which led to the two first unconscious creations.
We, therefore, are forced to conclude that the external
object cannot be loved, because a predominant amount
of libido prefers a phantastic object, which must be
brought up from the depths of the unconscious as a compensation
for the missing reality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The visionary phenomena, produced in the first stages
of introversion, are grouped among the well-known phenomena<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c008'><sup>[348]</sup></a>
of hypnagogic vision. They form, as I explained
in an earlier paper, the foundation of the true
visions of the symbolic autorevelations of the libido, as
we may now express it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller continues:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then I had the impression that some communication was
immediately impending. It seemed to me as if there were re-echoed
in me the words, ‘Speak, O Lord, for Thy servant listens;
open Thou mine ears!’”</p>

<p class='c007'>This passage very clearly describes the intention; the
expression “communication” is even a current term in
spiritualistic circles. The Biblical words contain a clear
invocation or “prayer,” that is to say, a wish (libido)
directed towards divinity (the unconscious complex).
The prayer refers to Samuel, i:3, where Samuel at night
was three times called by God, but believed that it was Eli
calling, until the latter informed him that it was God
himself who spoke, and that he must answer if his name
was called again—“Speak, O Lord, for Thy Servant
hears!” The dreamer uses these words really in an inverse
sense, namely, in order to produce God with them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>With that she directs her desires, her libido, into the
depths of her unconscious.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know that, although individuals are widely separated
by the differences in the contents of their consciousness,
they are closely alike in their unconscious psychology.
It is a significant impression for one working in
practical psychoanalysis when he realizes how uniform
are the typical unconscious complexes. Difference first
arises from individualization. This fact gives to an essential
portion of the Schopenhauer and Hartmann
philosophies a deep psychologic justification.<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c008'><sup>[349]</sup></a> The very
evident uniformity of the unconscious mechanism serves
as a psychologic foundation for these philosophic views.
The unconscious contains the differentiated remnants of
the earlier psychologic functions overcome by the individual
differentiation. The reaction and products of the
animal psyche are of a generally diffused uniformity and
solidity, which, among men, may be discovered apparently
only in traces. Man appears as something extraordinarily
individual in contrast with animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>This might be a tremendous delusion, because we have
the appropriate tendency always to recognize only the
difference of things. This is demanded by the psychologic
adaptation which, without the most minute differentiation
of the impressions, would be absolutely impossible.
In opposition to this tendency we have ever the
greatest difficulty in recognizing in their common relations
the things with which we are occupied in every-day
life. This recognition becomes much easier with
things which are more remote from us. For example, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>is almost impossible for a European to differentiate the
faces in a Chinese throng, although the Chinese have just
as individual facial formations as the Europeans, but the
similarity of their strange facial expression is much more
evident to the remote onlooker than their individual differences.
But when we live among the Chinese then the
impression of their uniformity disappears more and
more, and finally the Chinese become individuals also.
Individuality belongs to those conditional actualities which
are greatly overrated theoretically on account of their
practical significance. It does not belong to those overwhelmingly
clear and therefore universally obtrusive general
facts upon which a science must primarily be founded.
The individual content of consciousness is, therefore, the
most unfavorable object imaginable for psychology, because
it has veiled the universally valid until it has become
unrecognizable. The essence of consciousness is the
process of adaptation which takes place in the most
minute details. On the other hand, the unconscious is the
generally diffused, which not only binds the individuals
among themselves to the race, but also unites them backwards
with the peoples of the past and their psychology.
Thus the unconscious, surpassing the individual in its
generality, is, in the first place, the object of a true psychology,
which claims not to be psychophysical.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man as an individual is a suspicious phenomenon, the
right of whose existence from a natural biological standpoint
could be seriously contested, because, from this
point of view, the individual is only a race atom, and
has a significance only as a mass constituent. The ethical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>standpoint, however, gives to the human being an individual
tendency separating him from the mass, which, in
the course of centuries, led to the development of personality,
hand in hand with which developed the hero
cult, and has led to the modern individualistic cult of
personages. The attempts of rationalistic theology to
keep hold of the personal Jesus as the last and most
precious remnant of the divinity which has vanished beyond
the power of the imagination corresponds to this
tendency. In this respect the Roman Catholic Church
was more practical, because she met the general need of
the visible, or at least historically believed hero, through
the fact that she placed upon the throne of worship a
small but clearly perceptible god of the world, namely,
the Roman Pope, the Pater patrum, and at the same time
the Pontifex Maximus of the invisible upper or inner God.
The sensuous demonstrability of God naturally supports
the religious process of introversion, because the human
figure essentially facilitates the transference, for it is not
easy to imagine something lovable or venerable in a spiritual
being. This tendency, everywhere present, has been
secretly preserved in the rationalistic theology with its
Jesus historically insisted upon. This does not mean that
men loved the visible God; they love him, not as he is,
for he is merely a man, and when the pious wished to
love humanity they could go to their neighbors and their
enemies to love them. Mankind wishes to love in God
only their ideas, that is to say, the ideas which they project
into God. By that they wish to love their unconscious,
that is, that remnant of ancient humanity and the centuries-old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>past in all people, namely, the common property
left behind from all development which is given to all
men, like the sunshine and the air. But in loving this
inheritance they love that which is common to all. Thus
they turn back to the mother of humanity, that is to say,
to the spirit of the race, and regain in this way something
of that connection and of that mysterious and irresistible
power which is imparted by the feeling of belonging
to the herd. It is the problem of Antæus, who
preserves his gigantic strength only through contact with
mother earth. This temporary withdrawal into one’s self,
which, as we have already seen, signifies a regression to
the childish bond to the parent, seems to act favorably,
within certain limits, in its effect upon the psychologic
condition of the individual. It is in general to be expected
that the two fundamental mechanisms of the psychoses,
transference and introversion, are to a wide
extent extremely appropriate methods of normal reaction
against complexes; transference as a means of escaping
from the complex into reality; introversion as a means of
detaching one’s self from reality through the complex.</p>

<p class='c007'>After we have informed ourselves about the general
purposes of prayer, we are prepared to hear more about
the vision of our dreamer. After the prayer, “the head
of a sphinx with an Egyptian headdress” appeared, only
to vanish quickly. Here the author was disturbed, so
that for a moment she awoke. This vision recalls the
previously mentioned phantasy of the Egyptian statue,
whose rigid gesture is entirely in place here as a phenomenon
of the so-called functional category. The light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>stages of the hypnosis are designated technically as
“Engourdissement” (stiffening). The word Sphinx in
the whole civilized world signifies the same as riddle: a
puzzling creature who proposes riddles, like the Sphinx
of Oedipus, standing at the portal of his fate like a
symbolic proclamation of the inevitable. The Sphinx is
a semi-theriomorphic representation of that “mother
image” which may be designated as the “terrible
mother,” of whom many traces are found in mythology.
This interpretation is correct for Oedipus. Here the
question is opened. The objection will be raised that
nothing except the word “Sphinx” justifies the allusion
to the Sphinx of Oedipus. On account of the lack of
subjective materials, which in the Miller text are wholly
lacking in regard to this vision, an individual interpretation
would also be excluded. The suggestion
of an “Egyptian” phantasy (Part I, Chapter II) is
entirely insufficient to be employed here. Therefore we
are compelled, if we wish to venture at all upon an
understanding of this vision, to direct ourselves—perhaps
in all too daring a manner—to the available ethnographic
material under the assumption that the unconscious of the
present-day man coins its symbols as was done in the most
remote past. The Sphinx, in its traditional form, is a half-human,
half-animal creature, which we must, in part,
interpret in the way that is applicable to such phantastic
products. The reader is directed to the deductions in
the first part of this volume where the theriomorphic representations
of the libido were discussed. This manner
of representation is very familiar to the analyst, through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the dreams and phantasies of neurotics (and of normal
men). The impulse is readily represented as an animal,
as a bull, horse, dog, etc. One of my patients, who had
questionable relations with women, and who began the
treatment with the fear, so to speak, that I would surely
forbid him his sexual adventures, dreamed that I (his
physician) very skilfully speared to the wall a strange
animal, half pig, half crocodile. Dreams swarm with such
theriomorphic representations of the libido. Mixed
beings, such as are in this dream, are not rare. A series
of very beautiful illustrations, where especially the lower
half of the animal was represented theriomorphically,
has been furnished by Bertschinger.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c008'><sup>[350]</sup></a> The libido which
was represented theriomorphically is the “animal” sexuality
which is in a repressed state. The history of repression,
as we have seen, goes back to the incest problem,
where the first motives for moral resistance against sexuality
display themselves. The objects of the repressed
libido are, in the last degree, the images of father and
mother; therefore the theriomorphic symbols, in so far
as they do not symbolize merely the libido in general,
have a tendency to present father and mother (for example,
father represented by a bull, mother by a cow).
From these roots, as we pointed out earlier, might probably
arise the theriomorphic attributes of the Divinity.
In as far as the repressed libido manifests itself under
certain conditions, as anxiety, these animals are generally
of a horrible nature. In consciousness we are attached
by all sacred bonds to the mother; in the dream she pursues
us as a terrible animal. The Sphinx, mythologically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>considered, is actually a fear animal, which reveals distinct
traits of a mother derivate. In the Oedipus legend
the Sphinx is sent by Hera, who hates Thebes on account
of the birth of Bacchus; because Oedipus conquers the
Sphinx, which is nothing but fear of the mother, he must
marry Jocasta, his mother, for the throne and the hand
of the widowed queen of Thebes belonged to him who
freed the land from the plague of the Sphinx. The
genealogy of the Sphinx is rich in allusions to the problem
touched upon here. She is a daughter of Echnida, a mixed
being; a beautiful maiden above, a hideous serpent below.
This double creature corresponds to the picture of the
mother; above, the human, lovely and attractive half;
below, the horrible animal half, converted into a fear
animal through the incest prohibition. Echnida is derived
from the All-mother, the mother Earth, Gaea, who,
with Tartaros, the personified underworld (the place of
horrors), brought her forth. Echnida herself is the
mother of all terrors, of the Chimaera, Scylla, Gorgo, of
the horrible Cerberus, of the Nemean Lion, and of the
eagle who devoured the liver of Prometheus; besides this
she gave birth to a number of dragons. One of her sons
is Orthrus, the dog of the monstrous Geryon, who was
killed by Hercules. With this dog, her son, Echnida, in
incestuous intercourse, produced the Sphinx. These materials
will suffice to characterize that amount of libido
which led to the Sphinx symbol. If, in spite of the lack
of subjective material, we may venture to draw an inference
from the Sphinx symbol of our author, we must say
that the Sphinx represents an original incestuous amount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>of libido detached from the bond to the mother. Perhaps
it is better to postpone this conclusion until we have
examined the following visions.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Miss Miller had concentrated herself again, the
vision developed further:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Suddenly an Aztec appeared, absolutely clear in every detail;
the hands spread open, with large fingers, the head in profile,
armored, headdress similar to the feather ornaments of the American
Indian. The whole was somewhat suggestive of Mexican
sculpture.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The ancient Egyptian character of the Sphinx is replaced
here by American antiquity—by the Aztec. The
essential idea is neither Egypt nor Mexico, for the two
could not be interchanged; but it is the subjective factor
which the dreamer produces from her own past. I have
frequently observed in the analysis of Americans that
certain unconscious complexes, i.e. repressed sexuality,
are represented by the symbol of a Negro or an Indian;
for example, when a European tells in his dream, “Then
came a ragged, dirty individual,” for Americans and for
those who live in the tropics it is a Negro. When with
Europeans it is a vagabond or a criminal, with Americans
it is a Negro or an Indian which represents the individual’s
own repressed sexual personality, and the one
considered inferior. It is also desirable to go into the
particulars of this vision, as there are various things
worthy of notice. The feather cap, which naturally had
to consist of eagles’ feathers, is a sort of magic charm.
The hero assumes at the same time something of the sun-like
character of this bird when he adorns himself with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>its feathers, just as the courage and strength of the enemy
are appropriated in swallowing his heart or taking his
scalp. At the same time, the feather crest is a crown
which is equivalent to the rays of the sun. The historical
importance of the Sun identification has been seen in the
first part.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c008'><sup>[351]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Especial interest attaches to the hand, which is described
as “open,” and the fingers, which are described
as “large.” It is significant that it is the hand upon which
the distinct emphasis falls. One might rather have expected
a description of the facial expression. It is well
known that the gesture of the hand is significant; unfortunately,
we know nothing about that here. Nevertheless,
a parallel phantasy might be mentioned, which also puts
the emphasis upon hands. A patient in a hypnagogic
condition saw his mother painted on a wall, like a painting
in a Byzantine church. She held one hand up, open wide,
with fingers spread apart. The fingers were very large,
swollen into knobs on the ends, and each surrounded by
a small halo. The immediate association with this picture
was the fingers of a frog with sucking discs at the
ends. Then the similarity to the penis. The ancient setting
of this mother picture is also of importance. Evidently
the hand had, in this phantasy, a phallic meaning.
This interpretation was confirmed by a further very
remarkable phantasy of the same patient. He saw something
like a “sky-rocket” ascending from his mother’s
hand, which at a closer survey becomes a shining bird
with golden wings, a golden pheasant, as it then occurs
to his mind. We have seen in the previous chapter that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the hand has actually a phallic, generative meaning, and
that this meaning plays a great part in the production
of fire. In connection with this phantasy, there is but one
observation to make: fire was bored with the hand; therefore
it comes from the hand; Agni, the fire, was worshipped
as a golden-winged bird.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c008'><sup>[352]</sup></a> It is extremely significant
that it is the mother’s hand. I must deny myself
the temptation to enter more deeply into this. Let it be
sufficient to have pointed out the possible significance of
the hand of the Aztec by means of these parallel hand
phantasies. We have mentioned the mother suggestively
with the Sphinx. The Aztec taking the place of the
Sphinx points, through his suggestive hand, to parallel
phantasies in which the phallic hand really belongs to the
mother. Likewise we encounter an antique setting in
parallel phantasies. The significance of the antique,
which experience has shown to be the symbol for “infantile,”
is confirmed by Miss Miller in this connection in the
annotation to her phantasies, for she says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“In my childhood, I took a special interest in the Aztec fragments
and in the history of Peru and of the Incas.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the two analyses of children which have been
published we have attained an insight into the child’s
small world, and have seen what burning interests and
questions secretly surround the parents, and that the parents
are, for a long time, the objects of the greatest interest.<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c008'><sup>[353]</sup></a>
We are, therefore, justified in suspecting that
the antique setting applies to the “ancients,” that is to
say, the parents, and that consequently this Aztec has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>something of the father or mother in himself. Up to this
time indirect hints point only to the mother, which is
nothing remarkable in an American girl, because Americans,
as a result of the extreme detachment from the
father, are characterized by a most enormous mother
complex, which again is connected with the especial social
position of woman in the United States. This position
brings about a special masculinity among capable women,
which easily makes possible the symbolizing into a masculine
figure.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c008'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After this vision, Miss Miller felt that a name formed
itself “bit by bit,” which seemed to belong to this Aztec—“the
son of an Inca of Peru.” The name is “Chi-wan-to-pel.”
As the author intimated, something similar to
this belonged to her childish reminiscences. The act of
naming is, like baptism, something exceedingly important
for the creation of a personality, because, since olden
times, a magic power has been attributed to the name,
with which, for example, the spirit of the dead can be
conjured. To know the name of any one means, in
mythology, to have power over that one. As a well-known
example I mention the fairy tale of “Rumpelstilzchen.”
In an Egyptian myth, Isis robs the Sun god Rê permanently
of his power by compelling him to tell her his real
name. Therefore, to give a name means to give power,
invest with a definite personality.<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c008'><sup>[355]</sup></a> The author observed,
in regard to the name itself, that it reminded her very
much of the impressive name Popocatepetl, a name which
belongs to unforgettable school memories, and, to the
greatest indignation of the patient, very often emerges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>in an analysis in a dream or phantasy and brings with it
that same old joke which one heard in school, told oneself
and later again forgot. Although one might hesitate
to consider this unhallowed joke as of psychologic importance,
still one must inquire for the reason of its being.
One must also put, as a counter question, Why is it always
Popocatepetl and not the neighboring Iztaccihuatl, or
the even higher and just as clear Orizaba? The last has
certainly the more beautiful and more easily pronounced
name. Popocatepetl is impressive because of its onomatopoetic
name. In English the word is “to pop” (popgun),
which is here considered as onomatopoesy; in German
the words are <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hinterpommern</span></i>, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Pumpernickel</span></i>;
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bombe</span></i>; <em>Petarde</em> (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le pet</span></i> = flatus). The frequent German
word <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Popo</span></i> (Podex) does not indeed exist in English,
but flatus is designated as “to poop” in childish speech.
The act of defecation is often designated as “to pop.”
A joking name for the posterior part is “the bum.”
(Poop also means the rear end of a ship.) In French,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pouf!</span></i> is onomatopoetic; <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pouffer</span></i> = <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">platzen</span></i> (to explode),
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la poupe</span></i> = rear end of ship, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le poupard</span></i> = the baby in
arms, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la poupée</span></i> = doll. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Poupon</span></span></i> is a pet name for a
chubby-faced child. In Dutch <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">pop</span></i>, German <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Puppe</span></i> and
Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">puppis</span></i> = doll; in Plautus, however, it is also used
jokingly for the posterior part of the body; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pupus</span></i> means
child; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pupula</span></i> = girl, little dollie. The Greek word
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποππύζω</span> designates a cracking, snapping or blowing
sound. It is used of kissing; by Theocritus also of the associated
noise of flute blowing. The etymologic parallels
show a remarkable relationship between the part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>body in question and the child. This relationship we will
mention here, only to let it drop at once, as this question
will claim our attention later.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of my patients in his childhood had always connected
the act of defecation with a phantasy that his posterior
was a volcano and a violent eruption took place,
explosion of gases and gushings forth of lava. The
terms for the elemental occurrences of nature are
originally not at all poetical; one thinks, for example, of
the beautiful phenomenon of the meteor, which the German
language most unpoetically calls “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sternschnuppe</span>”
(the smouldering wick of a star). Certain South American
Indians call the shooting star the “urine of the stars.”
According to the principle of the least resistance, expressions
are taken from the nearest source available. (For
example, the transference of the metonymic expression
of urination as <em>Schiffens</em>, “to rain.”)</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it seems to be very obscure why the mystical
figure of Chiwantopel, whom Miss Miller, in a note,
compares to the control spirit of the spiritualistic medium,<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c008'><sup>[356]</sup></a>
is found in such a disreputable neighborhood that
his nature (name) was brought into relation with this
particular part of the body. In order to understand this
possibility, we must realize that when we produce from
the unconscious the first to be brought forth is the infantile
material long lost in memory. One must, therefore,
take the point of view of that time in which this infantile
material was still on the surface. If now a much-honored
object is related in the unconscious to the anus, then one
must conclude that something of a high valuation was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>expressed thereby. The question is only whether this
corresponds to the psychology of the child. Before we
enter upon this question, it must be stated that the anal
region is very closely connected with veneration. One
thinks of the traditional fæces of the Great Mogul. An
Oriental tale has the same to say of Christian knights,
who anointed themselves with the excrement of the pope
and cardinals in order to make themselves formidable.
A patient who is characterized by a special veneration
for her father had a phantasy that she saw her father
sitting upon the toilet in a dignified manner, and people
going past greeted him effusively.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c008'><sup>[357]</sup></a> The association of
the anal relations by no means excludes high valuation or
esteem, as is shown by these examples, and as is easily
seen from the intimate connection of fæces and gold.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c008'><sup>[358]</sup></a>
Here the most worthless comes into the closest relation
with the most valuable. This also happens in religious
valuations. I discovered (at that time to my great astonishment)
that a young patient, very religiously trained,
represented in a dream the Crucified on the bottom of a
blue-flowered chamber pot, namely, in the form of excrements.
The contrast is so enormous that one must assume
that the valuations of childhood must indeed be very
different from ours. This is actually the truth. Children
bring to the act of defecation and the products of this
an esteem and interest<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c008'><sup>[359]</sup></a> which later on is possible only
to the hypochondriac. We do not comprehend this interest
until we learn that the child very early connects
with it a theory of propagation.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c008'><sup>[360]</sup></a> The libido afflux probably
accounts for the enormous interest in this act. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>child sees that this is the way in which something is produced,
in which something comes out. The same child
whom I reported in the little brochure “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Über Konflikte
der kindlichen Seele</span>,” and who had a well-developed anal
theory of birth, like little Hans, whom Freud made known
to us, later contracted a habit of staying a long time on
the toilet. Once the father grew impatient, went to the
toilet and called, “Do come out of there; what are you
making?” Whereupon the answer came from within,
“A little wagon and two ponies.” The child was making
a little wagon and two ponies, that is to say, things which
at that time she especially wished for. In this way one
can make what one wishes, and the thing made is the
thing wished for. The child wishes earnestly for a doll
or, at heart, for a real child. (That is, the child practised
for his future biological task, and in the way in
which everything in general is produced he made the
doll<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c008'><sup>[361]</sup></a> himself as representative of the child or of the
thing wished for in general.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c008'><sup>[362]</sup></a>) From a patient I have
learned a parallel phantasy of her childhood. In the
toilet there was a crevice in the wall. She phantasied that
from this crevice a fairy would come out and present
her with everything for which she wished. The “locus”
is known to be the place of dreams where much was
wished for and created which later would no longer be
suspected of having this place of origin. A pathological
phantasy in place here is told us by Lombroso,<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c008'><sup>[363]</sup></a> concerning
two insane artists. Each of them considered himself
God and the ruler of the world. They created or produced
the world by making it come forth from the rectum,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>just as the egg of birds originates in the egg canal. One
of these two artists was endowed with a true artistic
sense. He painted a picture in which he was just in the
act of creation; the world came forth from his anus; the
membrum was in full erection; he was naked, surrounded
by women, and with all insignia of his power. The excrement
is in a certain sense the thing wished for, and on that
account it receives the corresponding valuation. When I
first understood this connection, an observation made
long ago, and which disturbed me greatly because I never
rightly understood it, became clear to me. It concerned
an educated patient who, under very tragic circumstances,
had to be separated from her husband and child, and was
brought into the insane asylum. She exhibited a typical
apathy and slovenliness which was considered as
affective mental deterioration. Even at that time I
doubted this deterioration, and was inclined to regard
it as a secondary adjustment. I took especial pains to
ascertain how I could discover the existence of the affect
in this case. Finally, after more than three hours’ hard
work, I succeeded in finding a train of thought which suddenly
brought the patient into a completely adequate and
therefore strongly emotional state. At this moment the
affective connection with her was completely reëstablished.
That happened in the forenoon. When I returned
at the appointed time in the evening to the ward to
see her she had, for my reception, smeared herself from
head to foot with excrement, and cried laughingly, “Do I
please you so?” She had never done that before; it was
plainly destined for me. The impression which I received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>was one of a personal affront and, as a result of
this, I was convinced for years after of the affective deterioration
of such cases. Now we understand this act
as an infantile ceremony of welcome or a declaration of
love.</p>

<p class='c007'>The origin of Chiwantopel, that is to say, an unconscious
personality, therefore means, in the sense of the
previous explanation, “I make, produce, invent him myself.”
It is a sort of human creation or birth by the anal
route. The first people were made from excrement, potter’s
earth, or clay. The Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lutum</span></i>, which really means
“moistened earth,” also has the transferred meaning of
dirt. In Plautus it is even a term of abuse, something
like “You scum.” The birth from the anus also reminds
us of the motive of “throwing behind oneself.” A well-known
example is the oracular command, which Deucalion
and Pyrrha, who were the only survivors from the
great flood, received. They were to throw behind them
the bones of the great mother. They then threw behind
them stones, from which mankind sprang. According to
a tradition, the Dactyli in a similar manner sprang from
dust, which the nymph Anchiale threw behind her. There
is also humorous significance attached to the anal products.
The excrements are often considered in popular
humor as a monument or memorial (which plays a special
part in regard to the criminal in the form of <em>grumus
merdæ</em>); every one knows the humorous story of the man
who, led by the spirit through labyrinthian passages to a
hidden treasure, after he had shed all his pieces of clothing,
deposited excrement as a last guide post on his road.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>In a more distant past a sign of this kind possessed as
great a significance as the dung of animals to indicate
the direction taken. Simple monuments (“little stone
figures”) have taken the place of this perishable mark.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is noteworthy that Miss Miller quotes another case,
where a name suddenly obtruded itself, parallel to the
emerging into consciousness of Chiwantopel, namely, A-ha-ma-ra-ma,
with the feeling that it dealt with something
Assyrian.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c008'><sup>[364]</sup></a> As a possible source of this, there occurred
to her “Asurabama, who made cuneiform bricks,”<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c008'><sup>[365]</sup></a>
those imperishable documents made from clay: the monuments
of the most ancient history. If it were not emphasized
that the bricks are “cuneiform,” then it might mean
ambiguously “wedged-shaped bricks,” which is more
suggestive of our interpretation than that of the
author.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller remarks that besides the name “Asurabama”
she also thought of “Ahasuerus” or “Ahasverus.”
This phantasy leads to a very different aspect of
the problem of the unconscious personality. While the
previous materials betrayed to us something of the infantile
theory of creation, this phantasy opens up a vista into
the dynamics of the unconscious creation of personality.
Ahasver is, as is well known, the Wandering Jew; he is
characterized by endless and restless wanderings until the
end of the world. The fact that the author has thought
of this particular name justifies us in following this trail.
The legend of Ahasver, the first literary traces of which
belong to the thirteenth century, seems to be of Occidental
origin, and belongs to those ideas which possess indestructible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>vital energy. The figure of the Wandering Jew
has undergone more literary elaboration than the figure
of Faust, and nearly all of this work belongs to the last
century. If the figure is not called Ahasver, still it is there
under another name, perhaps as Count of St. Germain,
the mysterious Rosicrucian, whose immortality was assured,
and whose temporary residence (the land) was
equally known.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c008'><sup>[366]</sup></a> Although the stories about Ahasver
cannot be traced back any earlier than the thirteenth century,
the oral tradition can reach back considerably
further, and it is not an impossibility that a bridge to the
Orient exists. There is the parallel figure of Chidr, or
“al Chadir,” the “ever-youthful Chidher” celebrated in
song by Rueckert. The legend is purely Islamitic. The
peculiar feature, however, is that Chidher is not only a
saint, but in Sufic circles<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c008'><sup>[367]</sup></a> rises even to divine significance.
In view of the severe monotheism of Islam, one is inclined
to think of Chidher as a pre-Islamitic Arabian
divinity who would hardly be officially recognized by the
new religion, but might have been tolerated on political
grounds. But there is nothing to prove that. The first
traces of Chidher are found in the commentaries of the
Koran, Buchâri and Tabare and in a commentary to a
noteworthy passage of the eighteenth sura of the Koran.
The eighteenth sura is entitled “the cave,” that is, after
the cave of the seven sleepers, who, according to the
legend, slept there for 309 years, and thus escaped persecution,
and awoke in a new era. Their legend is recounted
in the eighteenth sura, and divers reflections were
associated with it. The wish-fulfilment idea of the legend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>is very clear. The mystic material for it is the immutable
model of the Sun’s course. The Sun sets periodically,
but does not die. It hides in the womb of the sea or in a
subterranean cave,<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c008'><sup>[368]</sup></a> and in the morning is “born again,”
complete. The language in which this astronomic occurrence
is clothed is one of clear symbolism; the Sun returns
into the mother’s womb, and after some time is again
born. Of course, this event is properly an incestuous
act, of which, in mythology, clear traces are still retained,
not the least of which is the circumstance that the
dying and resurrected gods are the lovers of their own
mothers or have generated themselves through their own
mothers. Christ as the “God becoming flesh” has generated
himself through Mary; Mithra has done the
same. These Gods are unmistakable Sun-gods, for the
Sun also does this, in order to again renew himself.
Naturally, it is not to be assumed that astronomy came
first and these conceptions of gods afterwards; the process
was, as always, inverted, and it is even true that primitive
magic charms of rebirth, baptism, superstitious usages
of all sorts, concerning the cure of the sick, etc., were
projected into the heavens. These youths were born
from the cave (the womb of mother earth), like the Sun-gods,
in a new era, and this was the way they vanquished
death. In this far they were immortal. It is now interesting
to see how the Koran comes, after long ethical
contemplations in the course of the same sura, to the following
passage, which is of especial significance for the
origin of the Chidher myth. For this reason I quote
the Koran literally:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“Remember when Moses said to his servant, ‘I will not stop
till I reach the confluence of the two seas, or for eighty years will
I journey on.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“But when they reached their confluence they forgot their
fish, and it took its way in the sea at will.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And when they had passed on, Moses said to his servant,
‘Bring us our morning meal, for now we have incurred weariness
from this our journey.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“He said, ‘What thinkest thou? When we repaired to the
rock for rest, then verily I forgot the fish; and none but Satan
made me forget it, so as not to mention it; and it hath taken its
way in the sea in a wondrous sort.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“He said, ‘It is this we were in quest of.’ So they both went
back retracing their footsteps.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then found they one of our servants to whom we had vouchsafed
our mercy, and whom we had instructed with our knowledge;<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c008'><sup>[369]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“Moses said to him, ‘Shall I follow thee that thou teach me,
for guidance of that which thou hast been taught?’</p>

<p class='c017'>“He said, ‘Verily, thou canst by no means have patience with
me; and how canst thou be patient in matters whose meaning thou
comprehendest not?’”—Trans. Rodwell, page 188.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moses now accompanies the mysterious servant of God,
who does divers things which Moses cannot comprehend;
finally, the Unknown takes leave of Moses, and speaks to
him as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“They will ask thee of Dhoulkarnein (the two-horned).<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c008'><sup>[370]</sup></a>
Say: ‘I will recite to you an account of him.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“Verily, we established his power upon the earth and we gave
him a means to accomplish every end, so he followed his way;</p>

<p class='c017'>“Until when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it
to set in a miry forest; and hard by, he found a people....”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now follows a moral reflection; then the narrative continues:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“Then he followed his course further until he came to the place
where the sun rises....”</p>

<p class='c007'>If now we wish to know who is the unknown servant
of God, we are told in this passage <em>he is Dhulqarnein,
Alexander, the Sun; he goes to the place of setting and
he goes to the place of rising</em>. The passage about the
unknown servant of God is explained by the commentaries
in a well-defined legend. The servant is Chidher, “the
verdant one,” the never-tiring wanderer, who roams for
hundreds and thousands of years over lands and seas, the
teacher and counsellor of pious men; the one wise in
divine knowledge—the immortal.<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c008'><sup>[371]</sup></a> The authority of the
Tabari associates Chidher with Dhulqarnein; Chidher is
said to have reached the “stream of life” as a follower
of Alexander, and both unwittingly had drunk of it, so
that they became immortal. Moreover, <em>Chidher is identified
by the old commentators with Elias</em>, who also did
not die, but <em>who was taken to Heaven in a fiery chariot</em>.
Elias is <em>Helios</em>.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c008'><sup>[372]</sup></a> It is to be observed that Ahasver also
owes his existence to an obscure place in the holy Christian
scriptures. This place is to be found in Matthew xvi:28.
First comes the scene where Christ appoints Peter as the
rock of his church, and nominates him the governor of
his power.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c008'><sup>[373]</sup></a> After that follows the prophecy of his
death, and then comes the passage:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Verily, I say unto you, there be some standing here, which
shall not taste of death till they see the Son of Man coming in his
kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here follows the scene of the transfiguration:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine
as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
with him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then answered Peter and said unto Jesus, ‘Lord, it is good
for us to be here; if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles;
one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias.’”<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c008'><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>From these passages it appears that Christ stands on
the same plane as Elias, without being identified with
him,<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c008'><sup>[375]</sup></a> although the people consider him as Elias. The
ascension places Christ as identical with Elias. The
prophecy of Christ shows that there exist aside from
himself one or more immortals who shall not die until
Parousai. According to John xxi: 22nd verse, the boy
John was considered as one of these immortals, and in
the legend he is, in fact, not dead but merely sleeping
in the ground until Parousai, and breathes so that the
dust swirls round his grave.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c008'><sup>[376]</sup></a> As is evident, there are
passable bridges from Christ by way of Elias to Chidher
and Ahasuerus. It is said in an account of this legend<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c008'><sup>[377]</sup></a>
that Dhulqarnein led his friend Chidher to the “source
of life” in order to have him drink of immortality.<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c008'><sup>[378]</sup></a>
Alexander also bathed in the stream of life and performed
the ritual ablutions. As I previously mentioned in
a footnote, according to Matthew xvii: 12th verse, John
the Baptist is Elias, therefore primarily identical with
Chidher. Now, however, it is to be noted that in the
Arabian legend Chidher appears rather as a companion
or accompanied (Chidher with Dhulqarnein or with Elias,
“like unto them”; or identified with them<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c008'><sup>[379]</sup></a>). There are
therefore, two similar figures who resemble each other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>but who, nevertheless, are distinct. The analogous situation
in the Christian legend is found in the scene by
the Jordan where John leads Christ to the “source of
life.” Christ is there, the subordinate, John the superior,
similar to Dhulqarnein and Chidher, or Chidher and
Moses, also Elias. The latter relation especially is such
that Vollers compares Chidher and Elias, on the one
side, with Gilgamesh and his mortal brother Eabani;
on the other side, with the Dioscuri, one of whom is immortal,
the other mortal. This relation is also found in
Christ and John the Baptist,<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c008'><sup>[380]</sup></a> on the one hand, and Christ
and Peter, on the other. The last-named parallel only
finds its explanation through comparison with the Mithraic
mysteries, where the esoteric contents are revealed
to us through monuments. Upon the Mithraic marble
relief of Klagenfurt<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c008'><sup>[381]</sup></a> it is represented how with a halo
Mithra crowns Helios, who either kneels before him or
else floats up to him from below. Mithra is represented
on a Mithraic monument of Osterburken as holding in
his right hand the shoulder of the mystic ox above Helios,
who stands bowed down before him, the left hand resting
on a sword hilt. A crown lies between them on the
ground. Cumont observes about this scene that it probably
represents the divine prototype of the ceremony of
the initiation into the degree of Miles, in which a sword
and a crown were conferred upon the mystic. Helios is,
therefore, appointed the Miles of Mithra. In a general
way, Mithra seems to occupy the rôle of patron to Helios,
which reminds us of the boldness of Hercules towards
Helios. Upon his journey towards Geryon, Helios burns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>too hotly; Hercules, full of anger, threatens him with his
never-failing arrows. Therefore, Helios is compelled to
yield, and lends to the hero his Sun ship, with which he
was accustomed to journey across the sea. Thus Hercules
returns to Erythia, to the cattle herds of Geryon.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c008'><sup>[382]</sup></a> On
the monument at Klagenfurt, Mithra is furthermore represented
pressing Helios’s hand, either in farewell or as
a ratification. In a further scene Mithra mounts the
Chariot of Helios, either for the ascension or the “Sea
Journey.”<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c008'><sup>[383]</sup></a> Cumont is of the opinion that Mithra gives
to Helios a sort of ceremonious investiture and consecrates
him with his divine power by crowning him with
his own hands. This relation corresponds to that of
Christ to Peter. Peter, through his symbol, the cock, has
the character of a sun-god. After the ascension (or
sea journey) of Christ, he is the visible pontiff of the
divinity; he suffers, therefore, the same death (crucifixion)
as Christ, and becomes the great Roman
deity (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sol invictus</span></i>), the conquering, triumphant Church
itself, embodied in the Pope. In the scene of Malchus
he is always shown as the miles of Christ, to whom the
sword is granted, and as the rock upon which the Church
is founded. The crown<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c008'><sup>[384]</sup></a> is also given to him who possesses
the power to bind and to set free. Thus, Christ,
like the Sun, is the visible God, whereas the Pope, like
the heir of the Roman Cæsars, is <em>solis invicti comes</em>.
The setting sun appoints a successor whom he invests
with the power of the sun.<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c008'><sup>[385]</sup></a> Dhulqarnein gives Chidher
eternal life. Chidher communicates his wisdom to
Moses.<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c008'><sup>[386]</sup></a> There even exists a report according to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the forgetful servant of Joshua drinks from the well of
life, whereupon he becomes immortal, and is placed in a
ship by Chidher and Moses, as a punishment, and is cast
out to sea, once more a fragment of a sun myth, the
motive of the “sea journey.”<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c008'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The primitive symbol, which designates that portion
of the Zodiac in which the Sun, with the Winter Solstice,
again enters upon the yearly course, is the goat, fish sign,
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰγωκέρως</span>. The Sun mounts like a goat to the
highest mountain, and later goes into the water as a fish.
The fish is the symbol of the child,<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c008'><sup>[388]</sup></a> for the child before
his birth lives in the water like a fish, and the Sun, because
it plunges into the sea, becomes equally child and fish.
The fish, however, is also a phallic symbol,<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c008'><sup>[389]</sup></a> also a symbol
for the woman.<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c008'><sup>[390]</sup></a> Briefly stated, the fish is a libido
symbol, and, indeed, as it seems predominately <em>for the
renewal of the libido</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The journey of Moses with his servant is a life-journey
(eighty years). They grow old and lose their life force
(libido), that is, they lose the fish which “pursues its
course in a marvellous manner to the sea,” which means
the setting of the sun. When the two notice their loss,
they discover at the place where the “source of life” is
found (where the dead fish revived and sprang into the
sea) Chidher wrapped in his mantle,<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c008'><sup>[391]</sup></a> sitting on the
ground. According to another version, he sat on an
island in the sea, or “in the wettest place on earth,” that
is, he was just <em>born from the maternal depths</em>. Where
the fish vanished Chidher, “the verdant one,” was born
as a “son of the deep waters,” his head veiled, a Cabir,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>a proclaimer of divine wisdom; the old Babylonian
Oannes-Ea, who was represented in the form of a fish,
and daily came from the sea as a fish to teach the people
wisdom.<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c008'><sup>[392]</sup></a> His name was brought into connection with
John’s. With the rising of the renewed sun all that lived
in darkness, as water-animal or fish, surrounded by all
terrors of night and death,<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c008'><sup>[393]</sup></a> became as the shining fiery
firmament of the day. Thus the words of John the Baptist<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c008'><sup>[394]</sup></a>
gain especial meaning:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that
cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy
to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With Vollers we may also compare Chidher and Elias
(Moses and his servant Joshua) with Gilgamesh and
his brother Eabani. Gilgamesh wandered through the
world, driven by anxiety and longing, to find immortality.
His path led him across the seas to the wise Utnapishtim
(Noah), who knew how to cross the waters of death.
There Gilgamesh had to dive down to the bottom of the
sea for the magical herb which was to lead him back to
the land of men. When he had come again to his native
land a serpent stole the magic plant from him (the fish
again slid into the sea). But on the return from the
land of the blessed an immortal mariner accompanied
him, who, banished by a curse of Utnapishtim, was forbidden
to return to the land of the blessed. Gilgamesh’s
journey had lost its purpose on account of the loss of the
magic herb; instead he is accompanied by an immortal,
whose fate, indeed, we cannot learn from the fragments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>of the epic. This banished immortal is the model for
Ahasver, as Jensen<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c008'><sup>[395]</sup></a> aptly remarked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again we encounter the motive of the Dioscuri, mortal
and immortal, setting and rising sun. This <em>motive is also
represented as if projected from the hero</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sacrificium Mithriacum (the sacrifice of the bull)
is in its religious representation very often flanked by
the two Dadophores, Cautes and Cautopates, one with
a raised and the other with a lowered torch. They represent
brothers who reveal their character through the symbolic
position of the torch. Cumont connects them, not
without meaning, with the sepulchral “erotes” who as
genii with the reversed torches have traditional meaning.
The one is supposed to stand for death and the other for
life. I cannot refrain from mentioning the similarity between
the Sacrificium Mithriacum (where the sacrificed
bull in the centre is flanked on both sides by Dadophores)
to the Christian sacrifice of the lamb (ram). The
Crucified is also traditionally flanked by the two thieves,
one of whom ascends to Paradise, while the other descends
to Hell.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c008'><sup>[396]</sup></a> The idea of the mortal and the immortal
seems to have passed also into the Christian
worship. Semitic gods are often represented as flanked
by two Paredroi; for example, Baal of Edessa, accompanied
by Aziz and Monimoz (Baal as the Sun, accompanied
by Mars and Mercury, as expressed in astronomical
teachings). According to the Chaldean view,
the gods are grouped into triads. In this circle of ideas
belongs also the Trinity, the idea of the triune God, in
which Christ must be considered in his unity with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Father and the Holy Ghost. So, too, do the two thieves
belong inwardly to Christ. The two Dadophores are, as
Cumont points out, nothing but offshoots<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c008'><sup>[397]</sup></a> from the chief
figure of Mithra, to whom belongs a mysterious threefold
character. According to an account of Dionysus
Areopagita, the magicians celebrated a festival, “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοῦ
τριπλασίου Μίθρου</span>.”<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c008'><sup>[398]</sup></a><a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c008'><sup>[399]</sup></a> An observation likewise referring
to the Trinity is made by Plutarch concerning Ormuzd:
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρὶς ἑαυτὸν αὐξήσας ἀπέστησε τοῦ ἡλίου</span>.<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c008'><sup>[400]</sup></a> The
Trinity, as three different states of the unity, is also a
Christian thought. In the very first place this suggests
a sun myth. An observation by Macrobius 1:18 seems to
lend support to this idea:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hæ autem ætatum diversitates ad solem referuntur, ut parvulus
videatur hiemali solstitio, qualem Aegyptii proferunt ex
adyto die certa,&nbsp;... æquinoctio vernali figura iuvenis ornatur.
Postea statuitur ætas ejus plenissima effigie barbæ solstitio æstivo&nbsp;... exunde per diminutiones veluti senescenti quarta forma deus
figuratur.</span>”<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c008'><sup>[401]</sup></a><a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c008'><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As Cumont observes, Cautes and Cautapates occasionally
carry in their hands the head of a bull, and a scorpion.<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c008'><sup>[403]</sup></a>
Taurus and Scorpio are equinoctial signs, which
clearly indicate that the sacrificial scene refers primarily
to the Sun cycle; the rising Sun, which sacrifices itself at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>the summer solstice, and the setting Sun. In the sacrificial
scene the symbol of the rising and setting Sun was
not easily represented; therefore, this idea was removed
from the sacrificial image.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have pointed out above that the Dioscuri represent
a similar idea, although in a somewhat different form;
the one sun is always mortal, the other immortal. As
this entire sun mythology is merely a psychologic projection
to the heavens, the fundamental thesis probably is
as follows; just as man consists of a mortal and immortal
part, so the sun is a pair of brothers,<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c008'><sup>[404]</sup></a> one being mortal,
the other immortal. This thought lies at the basis of all
theology in general. Man is, indeed, mortal, but there
are some who are immortal, or there is something in us
which is immortal. Thus the gods, “a Chidher or a St.
Germain,” are our immortal part, which, though incomprehensible,
dwells among us somewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Comparison with the sun teaches us over and over
again that the gods are libido. It is that part of us
which is immortal, since it represents that bond through
which we feel that in the race we are never extinguished.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c008'><sup>[405]</sup></a>
It is life from the life of mankind. Its springs, which well
up from the depths of the unconscious, come, as does our
life in general, from the root of the whole of humanity,
since we are indeed only a twig broken off from the
mother and transplanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the divine in us is the libido,<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c008'><sup>[406]</sup></a> we must not wonder
that we have taken along with us in our theology
ancient representations from olden times, which give the
triune figure to the God. We have taken this <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριπλάσιον</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θεόν</span><a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c008'><sup>[407]</sup></a> from the phallic symbolism, the originality of
which may well be uncontested.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c008'><sup>[408]</sup></a> The male genitals are
the basis for this Trinity. It is an anatomical fact that
one testicle is generally placed somewhat higher than
the other, and it is also a very old, but, nevertheless,
still surviving, superstition that one testicle generates a
boy and the other a girl.<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c008'><sup>[409]</sup></a> A late Babylonian bas-relief
from Lajard’s<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c008'><sup>[410]</sup></a> collection seems to be in accordance with
this view. In the middle of the image stands an androgynous
god (masculine and feminine face<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c008'><sup>[411]</sup></a>); upon the
right, male side, is found a serpent, with a sun halo round
its head; upon the left, female side, there is also a serpent,
with the moon above its head. Above the head of
the god there are three stars. This ensemble would seem
to confirm the Trinity<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c008'><sup>[412]</sup></a> of the representation. The Sun
serpent at the right side is male; the serpent at the left
side is female (signified by the moon). This image possesses
a symbolic sexual suffix, which makes the sexual
significance of the whole obtrusive. Upon the male side
a rhomb is found—a favorite symbol of the female genitals;
upon the female side there is a wheel or felly. A
wheel always refers to the Sun, but the spokes are thickened
and enlarged at the ends, which suggests phallic
symbolism. It seems to be a phallic wheel, which was
not unknown in antiquity. There are obscene bas-reliefs
where Cupid turns a wheel of nothing but phalli.<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c008'><sup>[413]</sup></a> It is
not only the serpent which suggests the phallic significance
of the Sun; I quote one especially marked case, from an
abundance of proof. In the antique collection at Verona
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>I discovered a late Roman mystic inscription in which are
the following representations:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_229.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>These symbols are easily read: Sun—Phallus, Moon—Vagina
(Uterus). This interpretation is confirmed by
another figure of the same collection. There the same
representation is found, only the vessel<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c008'><sup>[414]</sup></a> is replaced by
the figure of a woman. The impressions on coins, where
in the middle a palm is seen encoiled by a snake, flanked
by two stones (testicles), or else in the middle a stone
encircled by a snake; to the right a palm, to the left a
shell (female genitals<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c008'><sup>[415]</sup></a>), should be interpreted in a
similar manner. In Lajard’s “Researches” (“The Cult
of Venus”) there is a coin of Perga, where Artemis of
Perga is represented by a conical stone (phallic) flanked
by a man (claimed to be Men) and by a female figure
(claimed to be Artemis). Men (the so-called Lunus) is
found upon an Attic bas-relief apparently with the spear
but fundamentally a sceptre with a phallic significance,
flanked by Pan with a club (phallus) and a female
figure.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c008'><sup>[416]</sup></a> The traditional representation of the Crucified
flanked by John and Mary is closely associated with this
circle of ideas, precisely as is the Crucified with the
thieves. From this we see how, beside the Sun, there
emerges again and again the much more primitive comparison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>of the libido with the phallus. An especial trace
still deserves mention here. The Dadophor Cautapates,
who represents Mithra, is also represented with the cock<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c008'><sup>[417]</sup></a>
and the pineapple. But these are the attributes of the
Phrygian god Men, whose cult was widely diffused. Men
was represented with Pileus,<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c008'><sup>[418]</sup></a> the pineapple and the cock,
also in the form of a boy, just as the Dadophores are
boyish figures. (This last-named property relates them
with Men to the Cabiri.) Men has a very close connection
with Attis, the son and lover of Cybele. In the time
of the Roman Cæsars, Men and Attis were entirely identified,
as stated above. Attis also wears the Pileus like
Men, Mithra and the Dadophores. As the son and lover
of his mother he again leads us to the source of this
religion-creating incest libido, namely, to the mother.
Incest leads logically to ceremonial castration in the
Attic-Cybele cult, for the Hero, driven insane by his
mother, mutilates himself.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c008'><sup>[419]</sup></a> I must at present forego
entering more deeply into this matter, because the incest
problem is to be discussed at the close. Let this suggestion
suffice—that from different directions the analysis
of the libido symbolism always leads back again to the
mother incest. Therefore, we may surmise that the longing
of the libido raised to God (repressed into the unconscious)
is a primitive, incestuous one which concerns
the mother. Through renouncing the virility to the first
beloved, the mother, the feminine element becomes extremely
predominant; hence the strongly androgynous
character of the dying and resurrected Redeemer. That
these heroes are nearly always wanderers<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c008'><sup>[420]</sup></a> is a psychologically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>clear symbolism. The wandering is a representation
of longing,<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c008'><sup>[421]</sup></a> of the ever-restless desire, which
nowhere finds its object, for, unknown to itself, it seeks
the lost mother. The wandering association renders the
Sun comparison easily intelligible; also, under this aspect,
the heroes always resemble the wandering Sun, which
seems to justify the fact that the myth of the hero is a
sun myth. But the myth of the hero, however, is, as it
appears to me, the myth of our own suffering unconscious,
which has an unquenchable longing for all the
deepest sources of our own being; for the body of the
mother, and through it for communion with infinite life
in the countless forms of existence. Here I must introduce
the words of the Master who has divined the deepest

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>SYMBOLISM OF THE MOTHER AND OF REBIRTH</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The vision following the creation of the hero is described
by Miss Miller as a “throng of people.” This
representation is known to us from dream interpretation
as being, above all, the symbol of mystery.<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c008'><sup>[423]</sup></a> Freud
thinks that this choice of symbol is determined on account
of its possibility of representing the idea. The
bearer of the mystery is placed in opposition to the multitude
of the ignorant. <em>The possession of the mystery cuts
one off from intercourse with the rest of mankind.</em> For
a very complete and smooth rapport with the surroundings
is of great importance for the management of the
libido and the <em>possession of a subjectively important
secret generally creates a great disturbance</em>. It may be
said that the whole art of life shrinks to the one problem
of how the libido may be freed in the most harmless way
possible. Therefore, the neurotic derives special benefit
in treatment when he can at last rid himself of his various
secrets. The symbol of the crowd of people, chiefly the
streaming and moving mass, is, as I have often seen,
substituted for the great excitement in the unconscious,
especially in persons who are outwardly calm.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>The vision of the “throng” develops further; horses
emerge; a battle is fought. With Silberer, I might accept
the significance of this vision as belonging, first of all, in
the “functional category,” because, fundamentally, the
conception of the intermingling crowds is nothing but the
symbol of the present onrush of the mass of thought;
likewise the battle, and possibly the horses, which illustrate
the movement. The deeper significance of the appearance
of the horses will be seen for the first time in
the further course of our treatment of the mother symbolism.
The following vision has a more definite and
significantly important character. Miss Miller sees a
City of Dreams (“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cité de Rêves</span>”). The picture is
similar to one she saw a short time before on the cover
of a magazine. Unfortunately, we learn nothing further
about it. One can easily imagine under this “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cité de
Rêves</span>” a fulfilled wish dream, that is to say, something
very beautiful and greatly longed for; a sort of heavenly
Jerusalem, as the poet of the Apocalypse has dreamed it.
The city is a maternal symbol, a woman who fosters the
inhabitants as children. It is, therefore, intelligible that
the two mother goddesses, Rhea and Cybele, both
wear the wall crown. The Old Testament treats the
cities of Jerusalem, Babel, etc., as women (<cite>Isaiah</cite>
xlvii:1–5):</p>

<p class='c017'>“Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon,
sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans;
for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. Take
the millstones and grind meal; uncover thy locks, make bare the
leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers. That thy nakedness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen; sit thou silent,
and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for
thou shalt no more be called the lady of the kingdoms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jeremiah says of Babel (I:12):</p>

<p class='c017'>“Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall
be ashamed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Strong, unconquered cities are virgins; colonies are
sons and daughters. Cities are also whores. Isaiah says
of Tyre (xxiii:16):</p>

<p class='c017'>“Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot; thou hast been
forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And:</p>

<p class='c017'>“How does it come to pass that the virtuous city has become
an harlot?”</p>

<p class='c007'>We come across a similar symbolism in the myth of
Ogyges, the mythical king who rules in Egyptian Thebes
and whose wife was appropriately named Thebe. The
Bœotian Thebes founded by Cadmus received on that
account a surname, “Ogygian.” This surname was also
given to the great flood, as it was called “Ogygian” because
it occurred under Ogyges. This coincidence will be
found later on to be hardly accidental. The fact that
the city and the wife of Ogyges bear the same name indicates
that somewhere a relation must exist between the
city and the woman, which is not difficult to understand,
for the city is identical with the woman. We meet a
similar idea in Hindoo lore where Indra appears as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>husband of Urvara, but Urvara means “the fertile
land.” In a similar way the occupancy of a country by
the king was understood as marriage with the ploughed
land. Similar representations must have prevailed in
Europe as well. Princes had to guarantee, for example,
a good harvest at their accession. The Swedish King
Domaldi was actually killed on account of the failure of
the harvest (Ynglinga sâga 18). In the Rama sâga the
hero Rama marries Sîtâ, the furrow of the field.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c008'><sup>[424]</sup></a> To
the same group of ideas belongs the Chinese custom of
the Emperor ploughing a furrow at his ascension to the
throne. This idea of the soil being feminine also embraces
the idea of continual companionship with the
woman, a physical communication. Shiva, the Phallic
God, is, like Mahadeva and Parwati, male and female.
He has even given one-half of his body to his consort
Parwati as a dwelling place.<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c008'><sup>[425]</sup></a> Inman<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c008'><sup>[426]</sup></a> gives us a drawing
of a Pundite of Ardanari-Iswara; one-half of the god
is masculine, the other half feminine, and the genitals
are in continuous cohabitation. The motive of continuous
cohabitation is expressed in a well-known lingam
symbol, which is to be found everywhere in Indian
temples; the base is a female symbol, and within that is
the phallus.<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c008'><sup>[427]</sup></a> The symbol approaches very closely the
Grecian mystic phallic basket and chests. (Compare with
this the Eleusinian mysteries.) The chest or box is here
a female symbol, that is, the mother’s womb. This is a
very well-known conception in the old mythologies.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c008'><sup>[428]</sup></a> The
chest, basket or little basket, with its precious contents,
was thought of as floating on the water; a remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>inversion of the natural fact that the child floats in the
amniotic fluid and that this is in the uterus.</p>

<p class='c007'>This inversion brings about a great advantage for sublimation,
for it creates enormous possibilities of application
for the myth-weaving phantasy, that is to say, for
the annexation to the sun cycle. The Sun floats over the
sea like an immortal god, which every evening is immersed
in the maternal water and is born again renewed
in the morning. Frobenius says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Perhaps in connection with the blood-red sunrise, the idea
occurs that here a birth takes place, the birth of a young son; the
question then arises inevitably, whence comes the paternity? How
has the woman become pregnant? And since this woman symbolizes
the same idea as the fish, which means the sea, (because
we proceed from the assumption that the Sun descends into the
sea as well as arises from it) thus the curious primitive answer
is that this sea has previously swallowed the old Sun. Consequently
the resulting myth is, that the woman (sea) has formerly
devoured the Sun and now brings a new Sun into the world, and
thus she has become pregnant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All these sea-going gods are sun symbols. They are
enclosed in a chest or an ark for the “night journey on
the sea” (Frobenius), often together with a woman
(again an inversion of the actual situation, but in support
of the motive of continuous cohabitation, which we
have met above). During the night journey on the sea
the Sun-god is enclosed in the mother’s womb, oftentimes
threatened by dangers of all kinds. Instead of
many individual examples, I will content myself with reproducing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the scheme which Frobenius has constructed
from numberless myths of this sort:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_238.jpg' alt=' _To devour_ _West_      _East_ _W-E movement—(sea journey)_ _Heat-hair_ _To slip out_ _To open_ _To land_ _Sea journey_ _To set on fire or To cut off the heart_' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>Frobenius gives the following legend to illustrate this:</p>

<p class='c017'>“A hero is devoured by a water monster in the West (to
devour). The animal carries him within him to the East (sea
journey). Meanwhile, he kindles a fire in the belly of the
monster (to set on fire) and since he feels hungry he cuts off a piece
of the hanging heart (to cut off the heart). Soon after he notices
that the fish glides upon the dry land (to land); he immediately
begins to cut open the animal from within outwards (to open)
then he slides out (to slip out). In the fish’s belly, it had been
so hot, that all his hair had fallen out (heat-hair). The hero
frequently frees all who were previously devoured (to devour all)
and all now slide out (slip out).”</p>

<p class='c007'>A very close parallel is Noah’s journey during the
flood, in which all living creatures die; only he and the life
guarded by him are brought to a new birth. In a Melapolynesian
legend (Frobenius) it is told that the hero in
the belly of the King Fish took his weapon and cut open
the fish’s belly. “He slid out and saw a splendor, and
he sat down and reflected. ‘I wonder where I am,’ he
said. Then the sun rose with a bound and turned from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>one side to the other.” The Sun has again slipped out.
Frobenius mentions from the Ramayana the myth of
the ape Hanuman, who represents the Sun-hero. The
sun in which Hanuman hurries through the air throws a
shadow upon the sea. The sea monster notices this and
through this draws Hanuman toward itself; when the latter
sees that the monster is about to devour him, he stretches
out his figure immeasurably; the monster assumes the
same gigantic proportions. As he does that Hanuman
becomes as small as a thumb, slips into the great body
of the monster and comes out on the other side. In another
part of the poem it is said that he came out from
the right ear of the monster (like Rabelais’ Gargantua,
who also was born from the mother’s ear). “Hanuman
thereupon resumes his flight, and finds a new obstacle in
another sea monster, which is the mother of Rahus, the
sun-devouring demon. The latter draws Hanuman’s
shadow<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c008'><sup>[429]</sup></a> to her in the same way. Hanuman again has
recourse to the earlier stratagem, becomes small and slips
into her body, but hardly is he there than he grows to a
gigantic mass, swells up, tears her, kills her, and in that
way makes his escape.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we understand why the Indian fire-bringer Mâtariçvan
is called “the one swelling in the mother”; the
ark (little box, chest, cask, vessel, etc.) is a symbol of
the womb, just as is the sea, into which the Sun sinks
for rebirth. From this circle of ideas we understand the
mythologic statements about Ogyges; he it is who possesses
the mother, the City, who is united with the mother;
therefore under him came the great flood, for it is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>typical fragment of the sun myth that the hero, when
united with the woman attained with difficulty, is exposed
in a cask and thrown into the sea, and then lands for a
new life on a distant shore. The middle part, the “night
journey on the sea” in the ark, is lacking in the tradition
of Ogyges.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c008'><sup>[430]</sup></a> But the rule in mythology is that the typical
parts of a myth can be united in all conceivable variations,
which adds greatly to the extraordinary difficulty
of the interpretation of a particular myth without knowledge
of all the others. The meaning of this cycle of
myths mentioned here is clear; it is the longing <em>to attain
rebirth through the return to the mother’s womb, that is
to say, to become as immortal as the sun</em>. This longing
for the mother is frequently expressed in our holy scriptures.<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c008'><sup>[431]</sup></a>
I recall, particularly the place in the epistle
to the Galatians, where it is said (iv:26):</p>

<p class='c017'>(26) “But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the
mother of us all.</p>

<p class='c017'>(27) “For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that beareth not:
break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath
many more children than she which hath an husband.</p>

<p class='c017'>(28) “Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of
promise.</p>

<p class='c017'>(29) “But as he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
that was born after the spirit, even so it is now.</p>

<p class='c017'>(30) “Nevertheless, what sayeth the scripture? Cast out the
bondwoman and her son; for the son of a bondwoman shall not
be heir with the son of a freewoman.</p>

<p class='c017'>(31) “So, then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman,
but of the free.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Chapter v:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>(1) “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ
has made us free.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Christians are the children of the City Above, a
symbol of the mother, not sons of the earthly city-mother,
who is to be cast out; for those born after the flesh are
opposed to those born after the spirit, who are not born
from the mother in the flesh, but from a symbol for
the mother. One must again think of the Indians at this
point, who say the first people proceeded from the sword-hilt
and a shuttle. The religious thought is bound up with
the compulsion to call the mother no longer mother, but
City, Source, Sea, etc. This compulsion can be derived
from the need to manifest an amount of libido bound up
with the mother, but in such a way that the mother is
represented by or concealed in a symbol. The symbolism
of the city we find well-developed in the revelations of
John, where two cities play a great part, one of which
is insulted and cursed by him, the other greatly desired.
We read in Revelation (xvii:1):</p>

<p class='c017'>(1) “Come hither: I will shew unto thee the judgment of
the great whore that sitteth on many waters.</p>

<p class='c017'>(2) “With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication
and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk
with the wine of her fornication.</p>

<p class='c017'>(3) “So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness:
and I saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of the
names of blasphemy, and having seven heads and ten horns.</p>

<p class='c017'>(4) “And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colors,
and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a
golden cup<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c008'><sup>[432]</sup></a> in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of
her fornication.</p>

<p class='c017'>(5) “And upon her forehead was a name written: <em>Mystery.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Babylon the great. The Mother of Harlots and Abominations
of the Earth.</em></p>

<p class='c017'>(6) “And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of saints,
and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her
I wondered with a great admiration.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here follows an interpretation of the vision unintelligible
to us, from which we can only emphasize the point
that the seven heads<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c008'><sup>[433]</sup></a> of the dragon means the seven
hills upon which the woman sits. This is probably a distinct
allusion to Rome, the city whose temporal power
oppressed the world at the time of the Revelation. The
waters upon which the woman “the mother” sits are
“peoples and throngs and nations and tongues.” This
also seems to refer to Rome, for she is the mother of
peoples and possessed all lands. Just as in common
speech, for example, colonies are called daughters, so
the people subject to Rome are like members of a family
subject to the mother. In another version of the picture,
the kings of the people, namely, the fathers, commit
fornication with this mother. Revelation continues
(xviii: 2):</p>

<p class='c017'>(2) “And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon
the Great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of
devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every
unclean and hateful bird.</p>

<p class='c017'>(3) “For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath
of her fornication.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus this mother does not only become the mother of
all abominations, but also in truth the receptacle of all
that is wicked and unclean. The birds are images of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>souls;<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c008'><sup>[434]</sup></a> therefore, this means all souls of the condemned
and evil spirits. Thus the mother becomes Hecate, the
underworld, the City of the damned itself. We recognize
easily in the ancient idea of the woman on the
dragon,<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c008'><sup>[435]</sup></a> the above-mentioned representation of Echnida,
the mother of the infernal horrors. Babylon is the idea
of the “terrible” mother, who seduces all people to
whoredom with devilish temptation, and makes them
drunk with her wine. The intoxicating drink stands in
the closest relation to fornication, for it is also a libido
symbol, as we have already seen in the parallel of fire
and sun. After the fall and curse of Babylon, we find in
Revelation (xix:6–7) the hymn which leads from the
under half to the upper half of the mother, where now
everything is possible which would be impossible without
the repression of incest:</p>

<p class='c017'>(6) “Alleluia, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</p>

<p class='c017'>(7) “Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for
the marriage of the Lamb is come,<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c008'><sup>[436]</sup></a> and his wife hath made
herself ready.</p>

<p class='c017'>(8) “And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in
fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness
of saints.</p>

<p class='c017'>(9) “And he saith unto me, ‘Write, Blessed are they which
are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lamb is the son of man who celebrates his marriage
with the “woman.” Who the “woman” is remains
obscure at first. But Revelation (xxi:9) shows us
which “woman” is the bride, the Lamb’s wife:</p>

<p class='c017'>(9) “Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb’s
wife.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c008'><sup>[437]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>(10) “And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and
high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident from this quotation, after all that goes before,
that the City, the heavenly bride, who is here
promised to the Son, is the mother.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c008'><sup>[438]</sup></a> In Babylon the
impure maid was cast out, according to the Epistle to the
Galatians, so that here in heavenly Jerusalem the mother-bride
may be attained the more surely. It bears witness
to the most delicate psychologic perception that the
fathers of the church who formulated the canons preserved
this bit of the symbolic significance of the Christ
mystery. It is a treasure house for the phantasies and
myth materials which underlie primitive Christianity.<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c008'><sup>[439]</sup></a>
The further attributes which were heaped upon the heavenly
Jerusalem make its significance as mother overwhelmingly
clear:</p>

<p class='c017'>(1) “And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear
as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</p>

<p class='c017'>(2) “In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of
the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner
of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month, and the leaves of
the tree were for the healing of nations.</p>

<p class='c017'>(3) “And there shall be no more curse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In this quotation we come upon the symbol of the
waters, which we found in the mention of Ogyges in connection
with the city. The maternal significance of water
belongs to the clearest symbolism in the realm of mythology,<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c008'><sup>[440]</sup></a>
so that the ancients could say: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠ θάλασσα—τῆς
γενέσεως σύμβολον</span>.<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c008'><sup>[441]</sup></a> From water comes life;<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c008'><sup>[442]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>therefore, of the two gods which here interest us the most,
Christ and Mithra, the latter was born beside a river,
according to representations, while Christ experienced his
new birth in the Jordan; moreover, he is born from the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πηγή</span>,<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c008'><sup>[443]</sup></a> the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sempiterni fons amoris</span>,” the mother of
God, who by the heathen-Christian legend was made a
nymph of the Spring. The “Spring” is also found in
Mithracism. A Pannonian dedication reads, “Fonti
perenni.” An inscription in Apulia is dedicated to the
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fons Aeterni.</span>” In Persia, Ardvîçûra is the well of the
water of life. Ardvîçûra-Anahita is a goddess of water
and love (just as Aphrodite is born from foam). The
neo-Persians designate the Planet Venus and a nubile girl
by the name “Nahid.” In the temples of Anaitis there
existed prostitute Hierodules (harlots). In the Sakaeen
(in honor of Anaitis) there, occurred ritual combats as

maternal.<a href='#f443' class='c008'><sup>[443]</sup></a> All that is living rises as does the sun, from
the water, and at evening plunges into the water. Born
from the springs, the rivers, the seas, at death man arrives
at the waters of the Styx in order to enter upon the
“night journey on the sea.” The wish is that the black
water of death might be the water of life; that death,
with its cold embrace, might be the mother’s womb, just
as the sea devours the sun, but brings it forth again out
of the maternal womb (Jonah motive<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c008'><sup>[444]</sup></a>). Life believes

<p class='c007'>That <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξύλον ζωῆς</span>, the wood of life, or the tree of life, is
a maternal symbol would seem to follow from the previous
deductions. The etymologic connection of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕο</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕλε</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">υἱός</span>, in the Indo-Germanic root suggests the blending
of the meanings in the underlying symbolism of
mother and of generation. The tree of life is probably,
first of all, a fruit-bearing genealogical tree, that is, a
mother-image. Countless myths prove the derivation of
man from trees; many myths show how the hero is enclosed
in the maternal tree—thus dead Osiris in the
column, Adonis in the myrtle, etc. Numerous female
divinities were worshipped as trees, from which resulted
the cult of the holy groves and trees. It is of transparent
significance when Attis castrates himself under a pine
tree, i. e. he does it because of the mother. Goddesses
were often worshipped in the form of a tree or of a
wood. Thus Juno of Thespiæ was a branch of a tree,
Juno of Samos was a board. Juno of Argos was a
column. The Carian Diana was an uncut piece of wood.
Athene of Lindus was a polished column. Tertullian
calls Ceres of Pharos “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rudis palus et informe lignum
sine effigie.</span>” Athenaeus remarks of Latona at Dalos that
she is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξὐλινον ἄμορφον</span>, a shapeless piece of wood.<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c008'><sup>[445]</sup></a>
Tertullian calls an Attic Pallas “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">crucis stipes</span>,” a wooden
pale or mast. The wooden pale is phallic, as the name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>suggests, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάλης</span>, Pallus. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαλλός</span> is a pale, a ceremonial
lingam carved out of figwood, as are all Roman
statues of Priapus. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Φάλος</span> means a projection or centrepiece
on the helmet, later called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κῶνος</span> just as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναφαλ-αντίασις</span>
signifies baldheadedness on the forepart
of the head, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαλακρός</span> signifies baldheadedness in regard
to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάλος-κῶνος</span> of the helmet; a semi-phallic
meaning is given to the upper part of the head as well.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c008'><sup>[446]</sup></a>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Φάλληνος</span> has, besides <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαλλός</span>, the significance of
“wooden”; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαλ-άγγωμα</span>, “cylinder”; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάλαγξ</span>, “a round
beam.” The Macedonian battle array, distinguished by
its powerful impetus, is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάλαγξ</span>; moreover, the
finger-joint<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c008'><sup>[447]</sup></a> is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάλαγξ</span>. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάλλαινα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάλαινα</span>
is a whale. Now <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαλός</span> appears with the meaning
“shining, brilliant.” The Indo-Germanic root is <em>bhale</em>
= to bulge, to swell.<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c008'><sup>[448]</sup></a> Who does not think of Faust?</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>That is primitive libido symbolism, which shows how
immediate is the connection between phallic libido and
light. The same relations are found in the Rigveda in
Rudra’s utterances.</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>Rigveda</cite> 1, 114, 3:</p>

<p class='c017'>“May we obtain your favor, thou man ruling, Oh urinating
Rudra.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I refer here to the previously mentioned phallic symbolism
of Rudra in the Upanishads:</p>

<p class='c017'>(4) “We call for help below to the flaming Rudra, to the
one bringing the sacrifice; him who encircles and wanders (wandering
in the vault of Heaven) to the seer.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>2, 33, 5:</p>

<p class='c017'>“He who opens up the sweet, who listens to our calls, the
ruddy one, with the beautiful helmet, may he not give us over
to the powers of jealousy.</p>

<p class='c017'>(6) “I have been rejoiced by the bull connected with Marut,
the supplicating one with strong force of life.</p>

<p class='c017'>(8) “Sound the powerful song of praise to the ruddy bull to
the white shining one; worship the flaming one with honor, we
sing of the shining being Rudra.</p>

<p class='c017'>“May Rudra’s missile (arrow) not be used on us, may the
great displeasure of the shining one pass us by: Unbend the firm
(bow or hard arrow?) for the princes, thou who blessest with
the waters of thy body (generative strength), be gracious to our
children and grandchildren.”<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c008'><sup>[449]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In this way we pass from the realm of mother symbolism
imperceptibly into the realm of male phallic
symbolism. This element also lies in the tree, even in
the family tree, as is distinctly shown by the mediæval
family trees. From the first ancestor there grows upward,
in the place of the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">membrum virile</span>,” the trunk
of the great tree. The bisexual symbolic character of the
tree is intimated by the fact that in Latin trees have a
masculine termination and a feminine gender.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c008'><sup>[450]</sup></a> The
feminine (especially the maternal) meaning of the forest
and the phallic significance of trees in dreams is well
known. I mention an example.</p>

<p class='c007'>It concerns a woman who had always been nervous,
and who, after many years of marriage, became ill as a
result of the typical retention of the libido. She had the
following dream after she had learned to know a young
man of many engaging free opinions who was very pleasing
to her: She found herself in a garden where stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>a remarkable exotic tree with strange red fleshy flowers
or fruits. She picked them and ate them. Then, to her
horror, she felt that she was poisoned. This dream idea
may easily be understood by means of the antique or
poetic symbolism, so I can spare information as to the
analytic material.</p>

<p class='c007'>The double significance of the tree is readily explained
by the fact that such symbols are not to be understood
“anatomically” but psychologically as libido symbols;
therefore, it is not permissible to interpret the tree on
account of its similar form as directly phallic; it can also
be called a woman or the uterus of the mother. The
uniformity of the significance lies alone in the similarity
to the libido.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c008'><sup>[451]</sup></a> One loses one’s way in one “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cul de sac</span>”
after another by saying that this is the symbol substituted
for the mother and that for the penis. In this realm
there is no fixed significance of things. The only reality
here is the libido, for which “all that is perishable is
merely a symbol.” It is not the physical actual mother,
but the libido of the son, the object of which was once
the mother. We take mythologic symbols much too concretely
and wonder at every step about the endless contradictions.
These contradictions arise only because we
constantly forget that in the realm of phantasy “feeling
is all.” Whenever we read, therefore, “his mother was
a wicked sorcerer,” the translation is as follows: The
son is in love with her, namely, he is unable to detach his
libido from the mother-imago; he therefore suffers from
incestuous resistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The symbolism of water and trees, which are met with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>as further attributes in the symbol of the City, also refer
to that amount of libido which unconsciously is fastened
to the mother-imago. In certain parts of Revelation
the unconscious psychology of religious longing is revealed,
namely, the longing for the <em>mother</em>.<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c008'><sup>[452]</sup></a> The expectation
of Revelation ends in the mother: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καὶ πᾶν
κατάθεμα οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι</span> (“and there shall be no more
curse”). There shall be no more sins, no repression, no
disharmony with one’s self, no guilt, no fear of death and
no pain of separation more!</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus Revelation echoes that same radiant mystical
harmony which was caught again 2,000 years later and
expressed poetically in the last prayer of Dr. Marianus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Penitents, look up, elate,</div>

      <div class='line'>Be our souls, as they have been,</div>

      <div class='line'>Goddess, gracious be!”        —<em>Goethe: Faust.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One principal question arises at the sight of this beauty
and greatness of feeling, that is, whether the primary
tendency compensated by religion is not too narrowly
understood as incestuous. I have previously observed in
regard to this that I consider the “resistance opposed to
libido” as in a general way coincident with the incest prohibition.
I must leave open for the present the definition
of the psychological incest conception. However, I will
here emphasize the point that it is most especially the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>totality of the sun myth which proves to us that the
fundamental basis of the “incestuous” desire does not
aim at cohabitation, but at the special thought of becoming
a child again, of turning back to the parent’s protection,
of coming into the mother once more in order to be
born again. But incest stands in the path to this goal,
that is to say, the necessity of in some way again gaining
entrance into the mother’s womb. One of the simplest
ways would be to impregnate the mother, and to reproduce
one’s self identically. But here the incest prohibition
interferes; therefore, the myths of the sun or of rebirth
teem with all possible proposals as to how incest can be
evaded. A very simple method of avoidance is to transform
the mother into another being or to rejuvenate<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c008'><sup>[453]</sup></a>
her after birth has occurred, to have her disappear again
or have her change back. It is not incestuous cohabitation
which is desired, but the rebirth, which now is attained
most readily through cohabitation. But this is
not the only way, although perhaps the original one. The
resistance to the incest prohibition makes the phantasy
inventive; for example, it was attempted to impregnate
the mother by means of a magic charm of fertility (to
wish for a child). Attempts in this respect remain in
the stage of mythical phantasies; but they have one result,
and that is the exercise of the phantasy which
gradually produces paths through the creation of phantastic
possibilities, in which the libido, taking an active
part, can flow off. Thus the libido becomes <em>spiritualized
in an imperceptible manner</em>. The power “which always
wishes evil” thus creates a spiritual life. Therefore, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>religions, this course is now raised to a system. On that
account it is exceedingly instructive to see how religion
takes pains to further these symbolic transferences.<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c008'><sup>[454]</sup></a>
The New Testament furnishes us with an excellent example
in regard to this. Nicodemus, in the speech regarding
rebirth, cannot forbear understanding the matter
very realistically.</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>John</cite> iii:4:</p>

<p class='c017'>(4) “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter
a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Jesus endeavors to raise into purity the sensuous
view of Nicodemus’s mind moulded in materialistic
heaviness, and announces to him—really the same—and
yet not the same:</p>

<p class='c017'>(5) “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of
water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God.</p>

<p class='c017'>(6) “That which is born of the flesh is flesh: and that which
is born of the spirit is spirit.</p>

<p class='c017'>(7) “Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born
again.</p>

<p class='c017'>(8) “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the
sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither
it goeth; so is everyone that is born of the spirit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To be born of water means simply to be born from the
mother’s womb. To be born of the spirit means to be
born from the fructifying breath of the wind; this we
learn from the Greek text (where spirit and wind are expressed
by the same word, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πνεῦμα</span>) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ γεγεννημένον
ἐκ τῆς σαρκος σάρξ ἐστιν, καὶ τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τοῦ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>πνεύματος πνεῦμά ἐστιν.—Τὸ πνεῦμα ὅπου θέλει πνεῖ</span>,<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c008'><sup>[455]</sup></a>
etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>This symbolism rose from the same need as that which
produced the Egyptian legend of the vultures, the mother
symbol. They were only females and were fertilized by
the wind. One recognizes very clearly the ethical demand
as the foundation of these mythologic assertions:
<em>thou must say of the mother that she was not impregnated
by a mortal in the ordinary way, but by a spiritual
being in an unusual manner</em>. This demand stands in
strict opposition to the real truth; therefore, the myth
is a fitting solution. One can say it was a hero who died
and was born again in a remarkable manner, and in this
way attained immortality. The need which this demand
asserts is evidently a prohibition against a definite phantasy
concerning the mother. A son may naturally think
that a father has generated him in a carnal way, but not
that he himself impregnated the mother and so caused
himself to be born again into renewed youth. This incestuous
phantasy which for some reason possesses an
extraordinary strength,<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c008'><sup>[456]</sup></a> and, therefore, appears as a
compulsory wish, is repressed and, conforming to the
above demand, under certain conditions, expresses itself
again, symbolically, concerning the problem of birth, or
rather concerning individual rebirth from the mother.
In Jesus’s challenge to Nicodemus we clearly recognize
this tendency: “Think not carnally or thou art carnal,
but think symbolically, then art thou spirit.” It is evident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>how extremely educative and developing this compulsion
toward symbolism can be. Nicodemus would remain fixed
in low commonplaces if he did not succeed in raising himself
through symbols above this repressed incestuous
desire. As a righteous philistine of culture, he probably
was not very anxious for this effort, because men seem
really to remain satisfied in repressing the incestuous
libido, and at best to express it by some modest religious
exercises. Yet it seems to be important, on the other
side, that man should not merely renounce and repress
and thereby remain firmly fixed in the incestuous bond,
but that he should redeem those dynamic forces which
lie bound up in incest, in order to fulfil himself. For man
needs his whole libido, to fill out the boundaries of his
personality, and then, for the first time, he is in a condition
to do his best. The paths by which man may manifest
his incestuously fixed libido seem to have been
pointed out by the religious mythologic symbols. On this
account Jesus teaches Nicodemus: “Thou thinkest of
thy incestuous wish for rebirth, but thou must think that
thou art born from the water and that thou art generated
by the breath of the wind,<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c008'><sup>[457]</sup></a> and in this way thou shalt
share in eternal life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the libido which lies inactive in the incestuous
bond repressed and in fear of the law and the avenging
Father God can be led over into sublimation through the
symbol of baptism (birth from water) and of generation
(spiritual birth) through the symbol of the descent of the
Holy Ghost. Thus man becomes a child<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c008'><sup>[458]</sup></a> again and is
born into a circle of brothers and sisters; but his mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>is the “communion of the saints,” the church, and his
circle of brothers and sisters is humanity, with whom he is
united anew in the common inheritance of the primitive
symbol.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems that at the time in which Christianity had its
origin this process was especially necessary; for that
period, as the result of the incredible contrast between
slavery and the freedom of the citizens and masters, had
entirely lost the consciousness of the common bond of
mankind. One of the next and most essential reasons for
the energetic regression to the infantile in Christianity,
which goes hand in hand with the revival of the incest
problem, was probably to be found in the far-reaching
depreciation of women. At that time sexuality was so
easily attainable that the result could only be a very excessive
depreciation of the sexual object. The existence
of personal values was first discovered by Christianity,
and there are many people who have not discovered it
even in the present day. However, the depreciation of
the sexual object hinders the outflow of that libido which
cannot be satisfied by sexual activity, because it belongs
to an already desexualized higher order. (If it were
not so, a Don Juan could never be neurotic; but the contrary
is the case.) For how might those higher valuations
be given to a worthless, despised object? Therefore,
the libido, after having seen a “Helen in every
woman” for so long a time, sets out on a search for the
difficult to obtain, the worshipped, but perhaps unattainable,
goal, and which in the unconscious is the mother.
Therefore the symbolic needs, based on the incest resistance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>arise again in an increased degree, which promptly
transforms the beautiful, sinful world of the Olympian
Gods into incomprehensible, dreamlike, dark mysteries,
which, with their accessions of symbols and obscure meaningful
texts, remove us very far from the religious
feelings of that Roman-Græco world. When we see
how much trouble Jesus took to make acceptable to Nicodemus
the symbolic perception of things, that is to say,
really a repression and veiling over of the actual facts,
and how important it was for the history of civilization
in general, that people thought and still think in this
way, then we understand the revolt which is raised everywhere
against the psychologic discovery of the true background
of the neurotic or normal symbolism. Always
and everywhere we encounter the odious realm of sexuality,
which represents to all righteous people of to-day
something defiled. However, less than 2,000 years have
passed since the religious cult of sexuality was more or
less openly in full bloom. To be sure, they were heathen
and did not know better, but the nature of religious power
does not change from cycle to cycle. If one has once received
an effectual impression of the sexual contents of
the ancient cults, and if one realizes oneself that the religious
experience, that is, the union<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c008'><sup>[459]</sup></a> with the God of
antiquity, was understood by antiquity as a more or less
concrete coitus, then truly one can no longer fancy that
the motor forces of a religion have suddenly become
wholly different since the birth of Christ. Exactly the
same thing has occurred as with the hysteric who at first
indulges in some quite unbeautiful, infantile sexual manifestations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>and afterwards develops a hyperæsthetic negation
in order to convince every one of his special purity.
<em>Christianity, with its repression of the manifest sexual, is
the negative of the ancient sexual cult.</em> The original cult
has changed its tokens.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c008'><sup>[460]</sup></a> One only needs to realize how
much of the gay paganism, even to the inclusion of unseemly
Gods, has been taken into the Christian church.
Thus the old indecent Priapus celebrated a gay festival of
resurrection in St. Tychon.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c008'><sup>[461]</sup></a> Also partly in the physicians
Sts. Kosma and Damien, who graciously condescended to
accept the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">membra virilia</span>” in wax at their festival.<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c008'><sup>[462]</sup></a>
St. Phallus of old memories emerges again to be worshipped
in country chapels, to say nothing of the rest of
the paganism!</p>

<p class='c007'>There are those who have not yet learned to recognize
sexuality as a function equivalent to hunger and who,
therefore, consider it as disgraceful that certain taboo
institutions which were considered as asexual refuges are
now recognized as overflowing with sexual symbolism.
Those people are doomed to the painful realization that
such is still the case, in spite of their great revolt. One
must learn to understand that, opposed to the customary
habit of thought, psychoanalytic thinking reduces and
resolves those symbolic structures which have become
more and more complicated through countless elaboration.
This means a course of reduction which would
be an intellectual enjoyment if the object were different.
But here it becomes distressing, not only æsthetically, but
apparently also ethically, because the repressions which
are to be overcome have been brought about by our best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>intentions. We must commence to overcome our virtuousness
with the certain fear of falling into baseness on
the other side. This is certainly true, for virtuousness is
always inwardly compensated by a great tendency towards
baseness; and how many profligates are there who inwardly
preserve a mawkish virtue and moral megalomania?
Both categories of men turn out to be snobs
when they come in contact with analytic psychology, because
the moral man has imagined an objective and cheap
verdict on sexuality and the unmoral man is entirely unaware
of the vulgarity of his sexuality and of his incapacity
for an unselfish love. One completely forgets that
one can most miserably be carried away, not only by a
vice, but also by a virtue. There is a fanatic orgiastic
self-righteousness which is just as base and which entails
just as much injustice and violence as a vice.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time, when a large part of mankind is beginning
to discard Christianity, it is worth while to understand
clearly why it was originally accepted. It was accepted
in order to escape at last from the brutality of
antiquity. As soon as we discard it, licentiousness returns,
as impressively exemplified by life in our large
modern cities. This step is not a forward step, but a
backward one. It is as with individuals who have laid
aside one form of transference and have no new one.
Without fail they will occupy regressively the old path
of transference, to their great detriment, because the
world around them has since then essentially changed.
He who is repelled by the historical and philosophical
weakness of the Christian dogmatism and the religious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>emptiness of an historical Jesus, of whose person we know
nothing and whose religious value is partly Talmudic,
partly Hellenic wisdom, and discards Christianity, and
therewith Christian morality, is certainly confronted with
the ancient problem of licentiousness. To-day the individual
still feels himself restrained by the public hypocritical
opinion, and, therefore, prefers to lead a secret,
separate life, but publicly to represent morality. It
might be different if men in general all at once found the
moral mask too dull, and if they realized how dangerously
their beasts lie in wait for each other, and then
truly a frenzy of demoralization might sweep over humanity.
This is the dream, the wish dream, of the
morally limited man of to-day; he forgets necessity, which
strangles men and robs them of their breath, and which
with a stern hand interrupts every passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must not be imputed to me that I am wishing to
refer the libido back by analytical reduction to the primitive,
almost conquered, stages, entirely forgetting the fearful
misery this would entail for humanity. Indeed, some
individuals would let themselves be transported by the
old-time frenzy of sexuality, from which the burden of
guilt has been removed, to their own greatest detriment.</p>

<p class='c007'>But these are the ones who under other circumstances
would have prematurely perished in some other way.
However, I well know the most effectual and most inexorable
regulator of human sexuality. This is necessity.
With this leaden weight human lust will never fly too
high.</p>

<p class='c007'>To-day there are countless neurotics who are so simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>because they do not know how to seek happiness in their
own manner. They do not even realize where the lack
lies. And besides these neurotics there are many more
normal people—and precisely people of the higher type—who
feel restricted and discontented. For all these reduction
to the sexual elements should be undertaken, in
order that they may be reinstated into the possession of
their primitive self, and thereby learn to know and value
its relation to the entire personality. In this way alone
can certain requirements be fulfilled and others be repudiated
as unfit because of their infantile character. In
this way the individual will come to realize that certain
things are to be sacrificed, although they are accomplished,
<em>but in another sphere</em>. We imagine that we have
long renounced, sacrificed and cut off our incest wish,
and that nothing of it is left. But it does not occur to us
that this is not true, but that we unconsciously commit
incest in another territory. In religious symbols, for
example, we come across incest.<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c008'><sup>[463]</sup></a> We consider the incestuous
wish vanished and lost, and then rediscover it
in full force in religion. This process or transformation
has taken place unconsciously in secular development.
Just as in Part I it is shown that a similar unconscious
transformation of the libido is an ethically worthless pose,
and with which I compared the Christianity of early
Roman antiquity, where evidently licentiousness and brutality
were strongly resisted, so here I must remark in
regard to the sublimation of the incestuous libido, that
the belief in the religious symbol has ceased to be an
ethical ideal; but it is an unconscious transformation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the incest wish into symbolic acts and symbolic concepts
which cheat men, as it were, so that heaven appears to
them as a father and earth as a mother and the people
upon it children and brothers and sisters. Thus man can
remain a child for all time and satisfy his incest wish all
unawares. This state would doubtless be ideal<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c008'><sup>[464]</sup></a> if it were
not infantile and, therefore, merely a one-sided wish, which
maintains a childish attitude. <em>The reverse is anxiety.</em>
Much is said of pious people who remain unshaken in
their trust in God and wander unswervingly safe and
blessed through the world. I have never seen this Chidher
yet. It is probably a wish figure. The rule is great
uncertainty among believers, which they drown with
fanatical cries among themselves or among others; moreover,
they have religious doubts, moral uncertainty,
doubts of their own personality, feelings of guilt and,
deepest of all, great fear of the opposite aspect of reality,
against which the most highly intelligent people struggle
with all their force. This other side is the devil, the
adversary or, expressed in modern terms, the corrective
of reality, of the infantile world picture, which has been
made acceptable through the predominating pleasure
principle.<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c008'><sup>[465]</sup></a> But the world is not a garden of God, of
the Father, but a place of terrors. Not only is heaven
no father and earth no mother and the people not
brothers nor sisters, but they represent hostile, destroying
powers, to which we are abandoned the more surely,
the more childishly and thoughtlessly we have entrusted
ourselves to the so-called Fatherly hand of God. One
should never forget the harsh speech of the first Napoleon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>that the good God is always on the side of the
heaviest artillery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The religious myth meets us here as one of the greatest
and most significant human institutions which, despite
misleading symbols, nevertheless gives man assurance and
strength, so that he may not be overwhelmed by the
monsters of the universe. The symbol, considered from
the standpoint of actual truth, is misleading, indeed, but
it is <em>psychologically true</em>,<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c008'><sup>[466]</sup></a> because it was and is the bridge
to all the greatest achievements of humanity.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this does not mean to say that this unconscious
way of transformation of the incest wish into religious
exercises is the only one or the only possible one. There
is also a conscious recognition and understanding with
which we can take possession of this libido which is
bound up in incest and transformed into religious exercises
so that we no longer need the stage of religious
symbolism for this end. It is thinkable that instead of
doing good to our fellow-men, for “the love of Christ,”
we do it from the knowledge that humanity, even as ourselves,
could not exist if, among the herd, the one could
not sacrifice himself for the other. <em>This would be the
course of moral autonomy, of perfect freedom, when man
could without compulsion wish that which he must do,
and this from knowledge, without delusion through belief
in the religious symbols.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>It is a positive creed which keeps us infantile and,
therefore, ethically inferior. Although of the greatest
significance from the cultural point of view and of imperishable
beauty from the æsthetic standpoint, this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>delusion can no longer ethically suffice humanity striving
after moral autonomy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The infantile and moral danger lies in belief in the
symbol because through that we guide the libido to an
imaginary reality. The simple negation of the symbol
changes nothing, for the entire mental disposition remains
the same; we merely remove the dangerous object.
But the object is not dangerous; the danger is our own
infantile mental state, for love of which we have lost
something very beautiful and ingenious through the
simple abandonment of the religious symbol. I think
<em>belief should be replaced by understanding</em>; then we
would keep the beauty of the symbol, but still remain
free from the depressing results of submission to belief.
This would be the psychoanalytic cure for belief and disbelief.</p>

<p class='c006'>The vision following upon that of the city is that of a
“strange fir tree with gnarled branches.” This vision
does not seem extraordinary to us after all that we have
learned of the tree of life and its associations with the
city and the waters of life. This especial tree seems
simply to continue the category of the mother symbols.
The attribute “strange” probably signifies, as in dreams,
a special emphasis, that is, a special underlying complex
material. Unfortunately, the author gives us no individual
material for this. As the tree already suggested
in the symbolism of the city is particularly emphasized
through the further development of Miss Miller’s visions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>here, I find it necessary to discuss at some length the history
of the symbolism of the tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well known that trees have played a large part in
the cult myth from the remotest times. The typical myth
tree is the tree of paradise or of life which we discover
abundantly used in Babylonian and also in Jewish lore;
and in prechristian times, the pine tree of Attis, the tree
or trees of Mithra; in Germanic mythology, Ygdrasil
and so on. The hanging of the Attis image on the pine
tree; the hanging of Marsyas, which became a celebrated
artistic motive; the hanging of Odin; the Germanic hanging
sacrifices—indeed, the whole series of hanged gods—teaches
us that the hanging of Christ on the cross is not
a unique occurrence in religious mythology, but belongs
to the same circle of ideas as others. In this world of
imagery the cross of Christ is the tree of life, and equally
the wood of death. This contrast is not astounding.
Just as the origin of man from trees was a legendary idea,
so there were also burial customs, in which people were
buried in hollow trees. From that the German language
retains even now the expression “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Totenbaum</span>” (tree of
death) for a coffin. Keeping in mind the fact that the
tree is predominantly a mother symbol, then the mystic
significance of this manner of burial can be in no way
incomprehensible to us. <em>The dead are delivered back to
the mother for rebirth.</em> We encounter this symbol in
the Osiris myth, handed down by Plutarch,<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c008'><sup>[467]</sup></a> which is, in
general, typical in various aspects. Rhea is pregnant with
Osiris; at the same time also with Isis; Osiris and Isis
mate even in the mother’s womb (motive of the night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>journey on the sea with incest). Their son is Arueris,
later called Horus. It is said of Isis that she was born
“in absolute humidity” (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετάρτῃ δὲ τῆν Ἴσιν ἐν πανύγροις
γενέσθαι</span><a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c008'><sup>[468]</sup></a>). It is said of Osiris that a certain Pamyles
in Thebes heard a voice from the temple of Zeus
while drawing water, which commanded him to proclaim
that Osiris was born <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέγας βασιλεὺς εὐεργέτης Ὄσιρις</span>.<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c008'><sup>[469]</sup></a>
In honor of this the Pamylion were celebrated. They
were similar to the phallophorion. Pamyles is a phallic
demon, similar to the original Dionysus. The myth reduced
reads: Osiris and Isis were generated by phallus
from the water (mother womb) in the ordinary manner.
(Kronos had made Rhea pregnant, the relation was
secret, and Rhea was his sister. Helios, however, observed
it and cursed the relation.) Osiris was killed in
a crafty manner by the god of the underworld, Typhon,
who locked him in a chest. He was thrown into the Nile,
and so carried out to sea. Osiris, however, mated in the
underworld with his second sister, Nephthys (motive of
the night journey to the sea with incest). One sees here
how the symbolism is developed. In the mother womb,
before the outward existence, Osiris commits incest; in
death, the second intrauterine existence, Osiris again commits
incest. Both times with a sister who is simply substituted
for the mother as a legal, uncensured symbol,
since the marriage with a sister in early antiquity was not
merely tolerated, but was really commended. Zarathustra
also recommended the marriage of kindred. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>form of myth would be impossible to-day, because cohabitation
with the sister, being incestuous, would be
repressed. The wicked Typhon entices Osiris craftily
into a box or chest; this distortion of the true state of
affairs is transparent. The “original sin” caused men to
wish to go back into the mother again, that is, the incestuous
desire for the mother, condemned by law, is the
ruse supposedly invented by Typhon. The fact is, the
ruse is very significant. Man tries to sneak into rebirth
through subterfuge in order to become a child again.
An early Egyptian hymn<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c008'><sup>[470]</sup></a> even raises an accusation
against the mother Isis because she destroys the sun-god
Rê by treachery. It was interpreted as the ill-will of the
mother towards her son that she banished and betrayed
him. The hymn describes how Isis fashioned a snake,
put it in the path of Rê, and how the snake wounded the
sun-god with a poisonous bite, from which wound he
never recovered, so that finally he had to retire on the
back of the heavenly cow. But this cow is the cow-headed
goddess, just as Osiris is the bull Apis. The
mother is accused as if she were the cause of man flying
to the mother in order to be cured of the wound which
she had herself inflicted. This wound is the prohibition
of incest.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c008'><sup>[471]</sup></a> Man is thus cut off from the hopeful certainty
of childhood and early youth, from all the unconscious,
instinctive happenings which permit the child to
live as an appendage of his parents, unconscious of himself.
There must be contained in this many sensitive
memories of the animal age, where there was not any
“thou shalt” and “thou shalt not,” but all was just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>simple occurrence. Even yet a deep animosity seems to
live in man because a brutal law has separated him from
the instinctive yielding to his desires and from the great
beauty of the harmony of the animal nature. This separation
manifested itself, among other things, in the incest
prohibition and its correlates (laws of marriage, etc.);
therefore pain and anger relate to the mother, as if she
were responsible for the domestication of the sons of
men. In order not to become conscious of his incest wish
(his backward harking to the animal nature), the son
throws all the burden of the guilt on the mother, from
which arises the idea of the “terrible mother.”<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c008'><sup>[472]</sup></a> The
mother becomes for him a spectre of anxiety, a nightmare.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c008'><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After the completed “night journey to the sea,” the
chest of Osiris was cast ashore by Byblos, and lay in the
branches of an Erica, which grew around the coffin and
became a splendid tree. The king of the land had the
tree placed as a column under his roof.<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c008'><sup>[474]</sup></a> During this
period of Osiris’s absence (the winter solstice) the lament
customary during thousands of years for the dead god
and his return occurs, and its <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὕρεσις</span> is a feast of joy.
A passage from the mournful quest of Isis is especially
noteworthy:</p>

<p class='c017'>“She flutters like a swallow lamenting around the column,
which encloses the god sleeping in death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>(This same motive returns in the Kyffhäuser saga.)</p>

<p>FRUCTIFICATION FOLLOWING UPON THE MITHRAIC SACRIFICE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Later on Typhon dismembers the corpse and scatters
the pieces. We come upon the <em>motive of dismemberment</em> in countless sun myths,<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c008'><sup>[475]</sup></a> namely, the inversion of
the idea of the composition of the child in the mother’s
womb.<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c008'><sup>[476]</sup></a> In fact, the mother Isis collects the pieces of
the body with the help of the jackal-headed Anubis. (She
finds the corpse with the help of dogs.) Here the nocturnal
devourers of bodies, the dogs and jackals, become
the assistants of the composition, of the reproduction.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c008'><sup>[477]</sup></a>
The Egyptian vulture owes its symbolic meaning as
mother to this necrophagic habit. In Persian antiquity the
corpses were thrown out for the dogs to devour, just as
to-day in the Indian funeral pyres the removal of the
carcasses is left to the vultures. Persia was familiar with
the custom of leading a dog to the bed of one dying,
whereupon the latter had to present the dog with a morsel.<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c008'><sup>[478]</sup></a>
The custom, on its surface, evidently signifies that
the morsel is to belong to the dog, so that he will spare
the body of the dead, precisely as Cerberus was soothed
by the honey-cakes which Hercules gave to him in the
journey to hell. But when we bear in mind the jackal-headed
Anubis who rendered his good services in the
gathering together of the dismembered Osiris, and the
mother significance of the vulture, then the question arises
whether something deeper was not meant by this ceremony.
Creuzer has also concerned himself with this idea,
and has come to the conclusion that the astral form of
the dog ceremony, that is, the appearance of Sirius, the
dog star, at the period of the sun’s highest position, is
related to this in that the introduction of the dog has a
compensatory significance, death being thereby made, reversedly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>equal to the sun’s highest position. This is
quite in conformity with psychologic thought, which results
from the very general fact that death is interpreted
as entrance into the mother’s womb (rebirth). This interpretation
would seem to be supported by the otherwise
enigmatic function of the dog in the Sacrificium
Mithriacum. In the monuments a dog always leaps up
upon the bull killed by Mithra. However, this sacrifice
is probably to be interpreted through the Persian legend,
as well as through the monument, as the moment of the
<em>highest fecundity</em>. The most beautiful expression of this
is seen upon the magnificent Mithra relief of Heddernheim.
Upon one side of a large stone slab (formerly
probably rotating) is seen the stereotyped overthrowing
and sacrifice of the bull, but upon the other side stands
Sol, with a bunch of grapes in his hand, Mithra with
the cornucopia, the Dadophores with fruits, corresponding
to the legend that all fecundity proceeds from the
dead bull of the world, fruits from the horns, wine from
its blood, grain from the tail, cattle from its sperma, leek
from its nose, and so on. Silvanus stands above this
scene with the animals of the forest arising from him.
The significance suspected by Creuzer might very easily
belong to the dog in this connection.<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c008'><sup>[479]</sup></a> Let us now turn
back to the myth of Osiris. In spite of the restoration of
the corpse accomplished by Isis, the resuscitation succeeds
only incompletely in so far as the phallus of Osiris cannot
again be produced, because it was eaten by the fishes;
the power of life was wanting.<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c008'><sup>[480]</sup></a> Osiris as a phantom
once more impregnated Isis, but the fruit is Harpocrates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>who was feeble in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοῖς κάτωθεν γυίοις</span> (in the lower
limbs), that is, corresponding to the significance of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυῖον</span> (at the feet). (Here, as is plainly evident, foot
is used in the phallic meaning.) This incurability of the
setting sun corresponds to the incurability of Rê in the
above-mentioned older Egyptian sun hymn. Osiris, although
only a phantom, now prepares the young sun, his
son Horus, for a battle with Typhon, the evil spirit of
darkness. Osiris and Horus correspond to the father-son
symbolism mentioned in the beginning, which symbolic
figure, corresponding again to the above formulation,<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c008'><sup>[481]</sup></a>
is flanked by the well-formed and ugly figures of
Horus and Harpocrates, the latter appearing mostly as a
cripple, often represented distorted to a mere caricature.<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c008'><sup>[482]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>He is confused in the tradition very much with Horus,
with whom he also has the name in common. Hor-pi-chrud,
as his real name<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c008'><sup>[483]</sup></a> reads, is composed from <em>chrud</em>,
“child,” and <em>Hor</em>, from the adjective <em>hri</em> = up, on top,
and signifies the up-coming child, as the rising sun, and
opposed to Osiris, who personifies the setting sun—the
sun of the west. Thus Osiris and Horpichrud or Horus
are one being, both husband and son of the same mother,
Hathor-Isis. The Chnum-Ra, the sun god of lower
Egypt, represented as a ram, has at his side, as the female
divinity of the land, Hatmehit, who wears the fish on her
head. She is the mother and wife of Bi-neb-did (Ram,
local name of Chnum-Ra). In the hymn of Hibis,<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c008'><sup>[484]</sup></a>
Amon-ra was invoked:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thy (Chum-Ram) dwells in Mendes, united as the quadruple
god Thmuis. He is the phallus, the lord of the gods. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>bull of his mother rejoices in the cow (ahet, the mother) and
man fructifies through his semen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In further inscriptions Hatmehit was directly referred
to as the “mother of Mendes.” (Mendes is the Greek
form of Bi-neb-did: ram.) She is also invoked as the
“Good,” with the additional significance of <em>ta-nofert</em>, or
“young woman.” The cow as symbol of the mother is
found in all possible forms and variations of Hathor-Isis,
and also in the female Nun (parallel to this is the
primitive goddess Nit or Neith), the protoplasm which,
related to the Hindoo Atman,<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c008'><sup>[485]</sup></a> is equally of masculine
and feminine nature. Nun is, therefore, invoked as
Amon,<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c008'><sup>[486]</sup></a> the original water,<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c008'><sup>[487]</sup></a> which is in the beginning.
He is also designated as the father of fathers, the mother
of mothers. To this corresponds the invocation to the
female side of Nun-Amon, of Nit or Neith.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nit, the ancient, the mother of god, the mistress of Esne,
the father of fathers, the mother of mothers, who is the beetle
and the vulture, the being in its beginning.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nit, the ancient, the mother who bore the light god, Râ,
who bore first of all, when there was nothing which brought forth.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The cow, the ancient, which bore the sun, and then laid the
germ of gods and men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The word “nun” has the significance of young, fresh,
new, also the on-coming waters of the Nile flood. In a
transferred sense “nun” was also used for the chaotic
primitive waters; in general for the primitive generating
matter<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c008'><sup>[488]</sup></a> which was personified by the goddess Nunet.
From her Nut sprang, the goddess of heaven, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>represented with a starry body, and also as the heavenly
cow with a starry body.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the sun-god, little by little, retires on the back
of the heavenly cow, just as poor Lazarus returns into
Abraham’s bosom, each has the same significance; they
return into the mother, in order to rise as Horus. Thus
it can be said that in the morning the goddess is the
mother, at noon the sister-wife and in the evening again
the mother, who receives the dying in her lap, reminding
us of the Pietà of Michelangelo. As shown by the illustration
(from Dideron’s “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Iconographie Chrétienne</span>”),
this thought has been transferred as a whole into Christianity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the fate of Osiris is explained: he passes into
the mother’s womb, the chest, the sea, the tree, the
column of Astartes; he is dismembered, re-formed, and
reappears again in his son, Hor-pi-chrud.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before entering upon the further mysteries which the
beautiful myth reveals to us, there is still much to be said
about the symbol of the tree. Osiris lies in the branches
of the tree, surrounded by them, as in the mother’s womb.
The motive of <em>embracing and entwining</em> is often found
in the sun myths, meaning that it is the <em>myth of rebirth</em>.
A good example is the Sleeping Beauty, also the legend
of the girl who is enclosed between the bark and the
trunk, but who is freed by a youth with his horn.<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c008'><sup>[489]</sup></a> The
horn is of gold and silver, which hints at the sunbeam in
the phallic meaning. (Compare the previous legend of
the horn.) An exotic legend tells of the sun-hero, how he
must be freed from the plant entwining around him.<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c008'><sup>[490]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>A girl dreams of her lover who has fallen into the water;
she tries to save him, but first has to pull seaweed and
sea-grass from the water; then she catches him. In an
African myth the hero, after his act, must first be disentangled
from the seaweed. In a Polynesian myth the
hero’s ship was encoiled by the tentacles of a gigantic
polyp. Rê’s ship is encoiled by a night serpent on its
night journey on the sea. In the poetic rendering of the
history of Buddha’s birth by Sir Edwin Arnold (“The
Light of Asia,” p. 5) the motive of an embrace is also
found:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We come across a very similar motive in the cult legend
of the Samian Hera. Yearly it was claimed that the
image disappeared from the temple, was fastened somewhere
on the seashore on a trunk of a Lygos tree and
wound about with its branches. There it was “found,”
and was treated with wedding-cake. This feast is undoubtedly
a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερὸς γάμος</span> (ritual marriage), because in
Samos there was a legend that Zeus had first had a long-continued
secret love relation with Hera. In Plataea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>and Argos, the marriage procession was represented with
bridesmaids, marriage feast, and so on. The festival took
place in the wedding month “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γαμηλιών</span>” (beginning of
February). But in Plataea the image was previously
carried into a lonely place in the wood; approximately
corresponding to the legend of Plutarch that Zeus had
kidnapped Hera and then had hidden her in a cave of
Cithaeron. According to our deductions, previously
made, we must conclude from this that there is still another
train of thought, namely, the magic charm of a
rejuvenation, which is condensed in the Hierosgamos.
The disappearance and hiding in the wood, in the cave,
on the seashore, entwined in a willow tree, points to the
death of the sun and rebirth. The early springtime
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γαμηλιών</span> (the time of Marriage) in February fits in
with that very well. In fact, Pausanias informs us that
the Argivian Hera <em>became a maiden again by a yearly
bath in the spring of Canathos</em>. The significance of the
bath is emphasized by the information that in the
Plataeian cult of Hera Teleia, Tritonian nymphs appeared
as water-carriers. In a tale from the Iliad, where the
conjugal couch of Zeus upon Mount Ida is described, it is
said:<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c008'><sup>[492]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Drexler recognizes in this description an unmistakable

Gilgamesh, etc., hasten with the sun, in order to find
there immortality, where the sun and the maternal sea
unite in an eternally rejuvenating intercourse. Our supposition
of a condensation of the Hierosgamos with the
myth of rebirth is probably confirmed by this. Pausanias
mentions a related myth fragment where the statue of
Artemis Orthia is also called Lygodesma (chained with
willows), because it was found in a willow tree; this tale
seems to be related to the general Greek celebration of
Hierosgamos with the above-mentioned customs.<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c008'><sup>[493]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The motive of the “devouring” which Frobenius has
shown to be a regular constituent of the sun myths is
closely related to this (also metaphorically). The
“whale dragon” (mother’s womb) always “devours”
the hero. The devouring may also be partial instead of
complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>A six-year-old girl, who goes to school unwillingly,
dreams that her leg is encircled by a large red worm.
She had a tender interest for this creature, contrary to
what might be expected. An adult patient, who cannot
separate from an older friend on account of an extraordinarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>strong mother transference, dreams that “she had
to get across some deep water (typical idea!) with this
friend; her friend fell in (mother transference); she
tries to drag her out, and almost succeeds, but a large
crab seizes on the dreamer by the foot and tries to pull
her in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Etymology also confirms this conception: There is an
Indo-Germanic root <em>vélu-</em>, <em>vel-</em>, with the meaning of “encircling,
surrounding, turning.” From this is derived
Sanskrit <em>val</em>, <em>valati</em> = to cover, to surround, to encircle,
to encoil (symbol of the snake); <em>vallî</em> = creeping plant;
<em>ulûta</em> = boa-constrictor = Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">volûtus</span></i>, Lithuanian <i><span lang="lt" xml:lang="lt">velù</span></i>,
<i><span lang="is" xml:lang="is">velti</span></i> = <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wickeln</span></i> (to roll up); Church Slavonian <i><span lang="cu" xml:lang="cu">vlina</span></i> =
Old High German, <i><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">wella</span></i> = <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Welle</span></i> (wave or billow). To
the root <em>vélu</em> also belongs the root <em>vlvo</em>, with the meaning
“cover, corium, womb.” (The serpent on account of
its casting its skin is an excellent symbol of rebirth.)
Sanskrit <em>ulva</em>, <em>ulba</em> has the same meaning; Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">volva</span></i>,
<em>volvula</em>, <em>vulva</em>. To <em>vélu</em> also belongs the root <em>ulvorâ</em>,
with the meaning of “fruitful field, covering or husk
of plants, sheath.” Sanskrit <em>urvárâ</em> = sown field. Zend
<em>urvara</em> = plant. (See the personification of the ploughed
furrow.) The same root <em>vel</em> has also the meaning of
“wallen” (to undulate). Sanskrit <em>ulmuka</em> = conflagration.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ϝαλέα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ϝέλα</span>, Gothic <i><span lang="got" xml:lang="got">vulan</span></i> = <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wallen</span></i> (to undulate).
Old High German and Middle High German <i><span lang="gmh" xml:lang="gmh">walm</span></i> =
heat, glow.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c008'><sup>[494]</sup></a> It is typical that in the state of “involution”
the hair of the sun-hero always falls out from the
heat. Further the root <em>vel</em> is found with the meaning
“to sound,<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c008'><sup>[495]</sup></a> and to will, to wish” (libido!).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>The motive of encoiling is mother symbolism.<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c008'><sup>[496]</sup></a> This
is verified by the fact that the trees, for example, bring
forth again (like the whale in the legend of Jonah).
They do that very generally, thus in the Greek legend
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μελίαι νύμφαι</span><a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c008'><sup>[497]</sup></a> of the ash trees are the mothers of
the race of men of the Iron Age. In northern mythology,
Askr, the ash tree, is the primitive father. His wife,
Embla, is the “Emsige,” the active one, and not, as was
earlier believed, the aspen. <em>Askr</em> probably means, in the
first place, the phallic spear of the ash tree. (Compare
the Sabine custom of parting the bride’s hair with the
lance.) The Bundehesh symbolizes the first people,
Meschia and Meschiane, as the tree Reivas, one part of
which places a branch in a hole of the other part. The
material which, according to the northern myth, was animated
by the god when he created men<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c008'><sup>[498]</sup></a> is designated
as <em>trê</em> = wood, tree.<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c008'><sup>[499]</sup></a> I recall also <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</span> = wood, which in
Latin is called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">materia</span></i>. In the wood of the “world-ash,”
Ygdrasil, a human pair hid themselves at the end of the
world, from whom sprang the race of the renewed
world.<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c008'><sup>[500]</sup></a> The Noah motive is easily recognized in this
conception (the night journey on the sea); at the same
time, in the symbol of Ygdrasil, a mother idea is again
apparent. At the moment of the destruction of the world
the “world-ash” becomes the guardian mother, the tree
of death and life, one “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐγκόλπιον</span>.”<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c008'><sup>[501]</sup></a><a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c008'><sup>[502]</sup></a> This function of
rebirth of the “world-ash” also helps to elucidate the
representation met with in the Egyptian Book of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Dead, which is called “the gate of knowledge of the
soul of the East”:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am the pilot in the holy keel, I am the steersman who allows
no rest in the ship of Râ.<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c008'><sup>[503]</sup></a> I know that tree of emerald green
from whose midst Râ rises to the height of the clouds.”<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c008'><sup>[504]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Ship and tree of the dead (death ship and death tree)
are here closely connected. The conception is that Râ,
born from the tree, ascends (Osiris in the Erika). The
representation of the sun-god Mithra is probably explained
in the same way. He is represented upon the
Heddernheim relief, with half his body arising from the
top of a tree. (In the same way numerous other monuments
show Mithra half embodied in the rock, and illustrate
a rock birth, similar to Men.) Frequently there is
a stream near the birthplace of Mithra. This conglomeration
of symbols is also found in the birth of
Aschanes, the first Saxon king, who grew from the Harz
rocks, which are in the midst of the wood<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c008'><sup>[505]</sup></a> near a fountain.<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c008'><sup>[506]</sup></a>
Here we find all the mother symbols united—earth,
wood, water, three forms of tangible matter. We
can wonder no longer that in the Middle Ages the tree
was poetically addressed with the title of honor, “mistress.”
Likewise it is not astonishing that the Christian
legend transformed the tree of death, the cross, into
the tree of life, so that Christ was often represented on
a living and fruit-bearing tree. This reversion of the
cross symbol to the tree of life, which even in Babylon
was an important and authentic religious symbol, is also
considered entirely probable by Zöckler,<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c008'><sup>[507]</sup></a> an authority
on the history of the cross. The pre-Christian meaning
of the symbol does not contradict this interpretation; on
the contrary, its meaning is life. The appearance of the
cross in the sun worship (here the cross with equal arms,
and the swastika cross, as representative of the sun’s
rays), as well as in the cult of the goddess of love (Isis
with the crux ansata, the rope, the speculum veneris ♀,
etc.), in no way contradicts the previous historical meaning.
The Christian legend has made abundant use of this
symbolism.</p>

<p>CHRIST ON THE TREE OF LIFE</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>The student of mediæval history is familiar with the
representation of the cross growing above the grave of
Adam. The legend was that Adam was buried on Golgotha.
Seth had planted on his grave a branch of the
“paradise tree,” which became the cross and tree of
death of Christ.<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c008'><sup>[508]</sup></a> We all know that through Adam’s
guilt sin and death came into the world, and Christ
through his death has redeemed us from the guilt. To
the question in what had Adam’s guilt consisted it is said
that the unpardonable sin to be expiated by death was
that he dared to pick a fruit from the paradise tree.<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c008'><sup>[509]</sup></a>
The results of this are described in an Oriental legend.
One to whom it was permitted to cast one look into
Paradise after the fall saw the tree there and the four
streams. But the tree was withered, and in its branches
lay an infant. (The mother had become pregnant.<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c008'><sup>[510]</sup></a>)</p>

<p class='c007'>This remarkable legend corresponds to the Talmudic
tradition that Adam, before Eve, already possessed a
demon wife, by name Lilith, with whom he <em>quarrelled for
mastership</em>. But Lilith raised herself into the air through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>the magic of the name of God and hid herself in the sea.
Adam forced her back with the help of three angels.<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c008'><sup>[511]</sup></a>
Lilith became a nightmare, a Lamia, who threatened those
with child and who kidnapped the new-born child. The
parallel myth is that of the Lamias, the spectres of the
night, who terrified the children. The original legend is
that Lamia enticed Zeus, but the jealous Hera, however,
caused Lamia to bring only dead children into the world.
Since that time the raging Lamia is the persecutor of
children, whom she destroys wherever she can. This
motive frequently recurs in fairy tales, where the mother
often appears directly as a murderess or as a <em>devourer
of men</em>;<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c008'><sup>[512]</sup></a> a German paradigm is the well-known tale of
Hansel and Gretel. Lamia is actually a large, voracious
fish, which establishes the connection with the whale-dragon
myth so beautifully worked out by Frobenius, in
which the sea monster devours the sun-hero for rebirth
and where the hero must employ every stratagem to conquer
the monster. Here again we meet with the idea of
the “terrible mother” in the form of the voracious fish,
the mouth of death.<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c008'><sup>[513]</sup></a> In Frobenius there are numerous
examples where the monster has devoured not only men
but also animals, plants, an entire country, all of which
are redeemed by the hero to a glorious rebirth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lamias are typical nightmares, the feminine nature
of which is abundantly proven.<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c008'><sup>[514]</sup></a> Their universal peculiarity
is that they ride upon their victims. Their counterparts
are the spectral horses which bear their riders
along in a mad gallop. One recognizes very easily in
these symbolic forms the type of anxious dream which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>as Riklin shows,<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c008'><sup>[515]</sup></a> has already become important for the
interpretation of fairy tales through the investigation of
Laistner.<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c008'><sup>[516]</sup></a> The typical riding takes on a special aspect
through the results of the analytic investigation of infantile
psychology; the two contributions of Freud and
myself<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c008'><sup>[517]</sup></a> have emphasized, on one side, the anxiety significance
of the horse, on the other side the sexual meaning
of the phantasy of riding. When we take these experiences
into consideration, we need no longer be surprised
that the maternal “world-ash” Ygdrasil is called in German
“the frightful horse.” Cannegieter<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c008'><sup>[518]</sup></a> says of nightmares:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abigunt eas nymphas (matres deas, mairas) hodie rustici osse
capitis equini tectis injecto, cujusmodi ossa per has terras in
rusticorum villis crebra est animadvertere. Nocte autem ad concubia
equitare creduntur et equos fatigare ad longinqua itinera.</span>”<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c008'><sup>[519]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The connection of nightmare and horse seems, at first
glance, to be present also etymologically—nightmare and
mare. The Indo-Germanic root for märe is <em>mark</em>.
Märe is the horse, English mare; Old High German
<i><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">marah</span></i> (male horse) and <em>meriha</em> (female horse); Old
Norse <i><span lang="non" xml:lang="non">merr</span></i> (<em>mara</em> = nightmare); Anglo-Saxon <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">myre</span></i>
(<em>maira</em>). The French “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cauchmar</span>” comes from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">calcare</span></i>
= to tread, to step (of iterative meaning, therefore, “to
tread” or press down). It was also said of the cock who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>stepped upon the hen. This movement is also typical for
the nightmare; therefore, it is said of King Vanlandi,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mara trad han</span>,” the Mara trod on him in sleep even to
death.<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c008'><sup>[520]</sup></a> A synonym for nightmare is the “troll” or
“treter”<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c008'><sup>[521]</sup></a> (treader). This movement (<em>calcare</em>) is
proven again by the experience of Freud and myself with
children, where a special infantile sexual significance is
attached to stepping or kicking.</p>

<p class='c007'>The common Aryan root <em>mar</em> means “to die”; therefore,
<em>mara</em> the “dead” or “death.” From this results
<em>mors</em>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόρος</span> = fate (also <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span><a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c008'><sup>[522]</sup></a>). As is well known,
the Nornes sitting under the “world-ash” personify fate
like Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. With the Celts the
conception of the Fates probably passes into that of
<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">matres</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">matronæ</span></i>, which had a divine significance
among the Germans. A well-known passage in Julius
Cæsar (“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">De Bello Gallico</span>,” i: 50) informs us of this
meaning of the mother:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut matres familias eorum sortibus et vaticinationibus<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c008'><sup>[523]</sup></a> declararent,
utrum prœlium committi ex usu esset, nec ne.</span>”<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c008'><sup>[524]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In Slav <em>mara</em> means “witch”; poln. <em>mora</em> = demon,
nightmare; <i><span lang="gsw" xml:lang="gsw">mōr</span></i> or <i><span lang="gsw" xml:lang="gsw">mōre</span></i> (Swiss-German) means “sow,”
also as an insult. The Bohemian <i><span lang="cs" xml:lang="cs">mura</span></i> means “nightmare”
and “evening moth, Sphinx.” This strange connection
is explained through analysis where it often
occurs that animals with movable shells (Venus shell) or
wings are utilized for very transparent reasons as symbols
of the female genitals.<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c008'><sup>[525]</sup></a> The Sphingina are the twilight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>moths; they, like the nightmare, come in the darkness.
Finally, it is to be observed that the sacred olive
tree of Athens is called “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μορία</span>” (that was derived from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόρος</span>). Halirrhotios wished to cut down the tree, but
killed himself with the axe in the attempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sound resemblance of <em>mar</em>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mère</span></i> with <em>meer</em> = sea
and Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mare</span></i> = sea is remarkable, although etymologically
accidental. Might it refer back to “the great primitive
idea of the mother” who, in the first place, meant to
us our individual world and afterwards became the symbol
of all worlds? Goethe said of the mothers: “They
are encircled by images of all creatures.” The Christians,
too, could not refrain from reuniting their mother
of God with water. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave Maris stella</span>” is the beginning
of a hymn to Mary. Then again it is the horses
of Neptune which symbolize the waves of the sea. It is
probably of importance that the infantile word ma-ma
(mother’s breast) is repeated in its initial sound in all
possible languages, and that the mothers of two religious
heroes are called Mary and Maya. That the mother is
the horse of the child is to be seen most plainly in the
primitive custom of carrying the child on the back or letting
it ride on the hip. Odin hung on the “world-ash,”
the mother, his “horse of terror.” The Egyptian
sun-god sits on the back of his mother, the heavenly
cow.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already seen that, according to Egyptian conceptions,
Isis, the mother of god, played an evil trick on
the sun-god with the poisonous snake; also Isis behaved
treacherously toward her son Horus in Plutarch’s tradition.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>That is, Horus vanquished the evil Typhon, who
murdered Osiris treacherously (terrible mother = Typhon).
Isis, <em>however, set him free again</em>. Horus thereupon
rebelled, <em>laid hands on his mother and tore the regal
ornaments from her head</em>, whereupon Hermes gave her
a cow’s head. Then Horus conquered Typhon a second
time. Typhon, in the Greek legend, is a monstrous
dragon. Even without this confirmation it is evident that
the battle of Horus is the typical battle of the sun-hero
with the whale-dragon. Of the latter we know that it is
a symbol of the “dreadful mother,” of the voracious
jaws of death, where men are dismembered and ground
up.<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c008'><sup>[526]</sup></a> Whoever vanquishes this monster has gained a new
or eternal youth. For this purpose one must, in spite of
all dangers, descend into the belly of the monster<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c008'><sup>[527]</sup></a> (journey
to hell) and spend some time there. (Imprisonment
by night in the sea.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle with the night serpent signifies, therefore,
the conquering of the mother, who is suspected of an infamous
crime, that is, the betrayal of the son. A full
confirmation of the connection comes to us through the
fragment of the Babylonian epic of the creation, discovered
by George Smith, mostly from the library of Asurbanipal.
The period of the origin of the text was probably
in the time of Hammurabi (2,000 B.C.). We
learn from this account of creation<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c008'><sup>[528]</sup></a> that the sun-god Ea,
the son of the depths of the waters and the god of wisdom,<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c008'><sup>[529]</sup></a>
had conquered Apsû. Apsû is the creator of the
great gods (he existed in the beginning in a sort of trinity
with Tiâmat—the mother of gods and Mumu, his vizier).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Ea conquered the father, but Tiâmat plotted revenge.
She prepared herself for battle against the gods.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c007'>The gods finally opposed Marduk, the god of spring,
the victorious sun, against the fearful host of Tiâmat.
Marduk prepared for battle. Of his chief weapon, which
he created, it is said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>His chief weapon is the wind and a net, with which he
will entangle Tiâmat. He approaches Tiâmat and challenges
her to a combat.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then Tiâmat and Marduk, the wise one of the gods, came together,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rising for the fight, approaching to the battle:</div>
      <div class='line'>Then the lord spread out his net and caught her.</div>
      <div class='line'>He let loose the Imḫullu in his train at her face,</div>

      <div class='line'>With the raging winds he filled her womb.</div>

      <div class='line'>He threw down her body and stepped upon it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After Marduk slew the mother, he devised the creation
of the world.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There the lord rested contemplating her body,</div>

      <div class='line'>One half he took and with it he covered the Heavens.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In this manner Marduk created the universe from the
mother. It is clearly evident that the killing of the
mother-dragon here takes place under the idea of a wind
fecundation with negative accompaniments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The world is created from the mother, that is to say,
from the libido taken away from the mother through sacrifice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>We shall have to consider this significant formula
more closely in the last chapter. The most interesting
parallels to this primitive myth are to be found in the
literature of the Old Testament, as Gunkel<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c008'><sup>[531]</sup></a> has brilliantly
pointed out. It is worth while to trace the psychology
of these parallels.</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>Isaiah</cite> li:9:</p>

<p class='c017'>(9) “Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord;
awake as in the ancient days, in the generation of old. Art thou
not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?</p>

<p class='c017'>(10) “Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of
the great deep, that hath made the depths of the sea a way for
the ransomed to pass over?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The name of Rahab is frequently used for Egypt in
the Old Testament, also dragon. <cite>Isaiah</cite>, chapter xxx,
verse 7, calls Egypt “the silent Rahab,” and means,
therefore, something evil and hostile. Rahab is the well-known
whore of Jericho, who later, as the wife of Prince
Salma, became the ancestress of Christ. Here Rahab
appeared as the old dragon, as Tiâmat, against whose
evil power Marduk, or Jehovah, marched forth. The
expression “the ransomed” refers to the Jews freed
from bondage, but it is also mythological, for the hero
again frees those previously devoured by the whale.
(Frobenius.)</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>Psalm</cite>, lxxxix:10:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>Job</cite> xxvi:12–13:</p>

<p class='c017'>“He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding
he smiteth through the proud.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens, his hand hath
formed the crooked serpent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gunkel places Rahab as identical with Chaos, that is,
the same as Tiâmat. Gunkel translates “the breaking to
pieces” as “violation.” Tiâmat or Rahab as the mother
is also the whore. Gilgamesh treats Ishtar in this way
when he accuses her of whoredom. This insult towards
the mother is very familiar to us from dream analysis.
The dragon Rahab appears also as Leviathan, the water
monster (maternal sea).</p>

<p class='c017'><em>Psalm</em> lxxiv:</p>

<p class='c017'>(13) “Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest
the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>

<p class='c017'>(14) “Thou brakest the heads of Leviathan in pieces and
gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c017'>(15) “Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou
didst dry up mighty rivers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While only the phallic meaning of the Leviathan was
emphasized in the first part of this work, we now discover
also the maternal meaning. A further parallel is:</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>Isaiah</cite> xxvii:1:</p>

<p class='c017'>“In that day, the Lord with his cruel and great and strong
sword shall punish Leviathan, the piercing serpent, even Leviathan
that crooked serpent, and he shall slay the dragon that is in the
sea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We come upon a special motive in Job, chap. xli, v. 1:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Canst thou draw out Leviathan with an hook? or his tongue
with a cord which thou lettest down? Canst thou put an hook
in his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Numerous parallels to this motive are to be found
among exotic myths in Frobenius, where the maternal sea
monster was also fished for. The comparison of the
mother libido with the elementary powers of the sea
and the powerful monsters borne by the earth show how
invincibly great is the power of that libido which we designate
as maternal.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already seen that the incest prohibition prevents
the son from reproducing himself through the
mother. But this must be done by the god, as is shown
with remarkable clearness and candor in the pious Egyptian
mythology, which has preserved the most ancient and
simple concepts. Thus Chnum, the “moulder,” the
“potter,” the  “architect,” moulds his egg upon the potter’s
wheel, for he is “the immortal growth,” “the reproduction
of himself and his own rebirth, the creator of
the egg, which emerged from the primitive waters.” In
the Book of the Dead it says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am the sublime falcon (the Sun-god), which has come
forth from his egg.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another passage in the Book of the Dead reads:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am the creator of Nun, who has taken his place in the
underworld. My nest is not seen and my egg is not broken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A further passage reads:</p>

<p class='c017'>“that great and noble god in his egg: who is his own originator
of that which has arisen from him.”<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c008'><sup>[532]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore, the god Nagaga-uer is also called the
“great cackler.” (Book of the Dead.) “I cackle like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>a goose and I whistle like a falcon.” The mother is reproached
with the incest prohibition as an act of wilful
maliciousness by which she excludes the son from immortality.
Therefore, a god must at least rebel, overpower
and chastise the mother. (Compare Adam and Lilith,
above.) The “overpowering” signifies incestuous
rape.<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c008'><sup>[533]</sup></a> Herodotus<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c008'><sup>[534]</sup></a> has preserved for us a valuable
fragment of this religious phantasy.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And how they celebrate their feast to Isis in the city of
Busiris, I have already previously remarked. After the sacrifice,
all of them, men and women, full ten thousand people, begin to
beat each other. But it would be sin for me to mention for whom
they do beat each other.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But in Papremis they celebrated the sacrifice with holy actions,
as in the other places. About the time when the sun sets, some
few priests are busy around the image; most of them stand at
the entrance with wooden clubs, and others who would fulfil a
vow, more than a thousand men, also stand in a group with
wooden cudgels opposite them.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Now on the eve of the festival, they take the image out in
a small and gilded temple into another sacred edifice. Then the
few who remain with the image draw a four-wheeled chariot upon
which the temple stands with the image which it encloses. But
the others who stand in the anterooms are not allowed to enter.
Those under a vow, who stand by the god, beat them off. Now
occurs a furious battle with clubs, in which they bruise each other’s
bodies and as I believe, many even die from their wounds: notwithstanding
this, the Egyptians consider that none die.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The natives claim that this festival gathering was introduced
for the following reason: in this sanctuary lived the mother of
Ares.<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c008'><sup>[535]</sup></a> Now Ares was brought up abroad and when he became
a man he came to have <em>intercourse with his mother</em>. The servants
of his mother who had seen him did not allow him to enter peacefully,
but prevented him; at which he fetched people from another
city, who mistreated the servants and had entrance to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>mother. Therefore, they asserted that this slaughter was introduced
at the feast for Ares.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that the pious here fight their way to a share
in the mystery of the raping of the mother.<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c008'><sup>[536]</sup></a> This is the
part which belongs to them,<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c008'><sup>[537]</sup></a> while the heroic deed belongs
to the god.<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c008'><sup>[538]</sup></a> By Ares is meant the Egyptian Typhon,
as we have good reasons to suppose. <em>Thus Typhon represents
the evil longing for the mother</em> with which other
myth forms reproach the mother, according to the well-known
example. The death of Balder, quite analogous
to the death of Osiris (attack of sickness of Rê), because
of the wounding by the branch of the mistletoe, seems to
need a similar explanation. It is recounted in the myth
how all creatures were pledged not to hurt Balder, save
only the mistletoe, which was forgotten, presumably because
it was too young. This killed Balder. Mistletoe
is a parasite. The female piece of wood in the fire-boring
ritual was obtained<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c008'><sup>[539]</sup></a> from the wood of a parasitical or
creeping plant, the fire mother. The “mare” rests upon
“Marentak,” in which Grimm suspects the mistletoe.
The mistletoe was a remedy against barrenness. In Gaul
the Druid alone was allowed to climb the holy oak amid
solemn ceremonies after the completed sacrifice, in order
to cut off the ritual mistletoe.<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c008'><sup>[540]</sup></a> This act is a religiously
limited and organized incest. That which grows on the
tree is the child,<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c008'><sup>[541]</sup></a> which man might have by the mother;
then man himself would be in a renewed and rejuvenated
form; and precisely this is what man cannot have, because
the incest prohibition forbids it. As the Celtic custom
shows, the act is performed by the priest only, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>observation of certain ceremonies; the hero god and the
redeemer of the world, however, do the unpermitted, the
superhuman thing, and through it purchase immortality.
The dragon, who must be overcome for this purpose,
means, as must have been for some time clearly seen, the
resistance against the incest. Dragon and serpent, especially
with the characteristic accumulation of anxiety attributes,
are the symbolic representations of anxiety
which correspond to the repressed incest wish. It is,
therefore, intelligible, when we come across the tree with
the snake again and again (in Paradise the snake even
tempts to sin). The snake or dragon possesses in particular
the meaning of treasure guardian and defender.
The phallic, as well as the feminine, meaning of the
dragon<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c008'><sup>[542]</sup></a> indicates that it is again a symbol of the sexual
neutral (or bisexual) libido, that is to say, a symbol of the
<em>libido in opposition</em>. In this significance the black horse,
Apaosha, the demon of opposition, appears in the old
Persian song, Tishtriya, where it obstructs the sources
of the rain lake. The white horse Tishtriya makes two
futile attempts to vanquish Apaosha; at the third attempt,
with the help of Ahuramazda, he is successful.<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c008'><sup>[543]</sup></a> Whereupon
the sluices of heaven open and a fruitful rain pours
down upon the earth.<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c008'><sup>[544]</sup></a> In this song one sees very beautifully
in the choice of symbol how libido is opposed to
libido, will against will, the discordance of primitive man
with himself, which he recognizes again in all the adversity
and contrasts of external nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The symbol of the tree encoiled by the serpent may
also be translated as the mother defended from incest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>by resistance. This symbol is by no means rare upon
Mithraic monuments. The rock encircled by a snake is
to be comprehended similarly, because Mithra is one
born from a rock. The menace of the new-born by the
snake (Mithra, Hercules) is made clear through the
legend of Lilith and Lamia. Python, the dragon of Leto,
and Poine, who devastates the land of Crotopus, are sent
by the father of the new-born. This idea indicates the
localization, well known in psychoanalysis, of the incest
anxiety in the father. The father represents the active
repulse of the incest wish of the son. The crime, unconsciously
wished for by the son, is imputed to the father
under the guise of a pretended murderous purpose, this
being the cause of the mortal fear of the son for the
father, a frequent neurotic symptom. In conformity with
this idea, the monster to be overcome by the young hero
is frequently a giant, the guardian of the treasure or the
woman. A striking example is the giant Chumbaba in
the Gilgamesh epic, who protected the garden of
Ishtar;<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c008'><sup>[545]</sup></a> he is overcome by Gilgamesh, whereby Ishtar
is won. Thereupon she makes erotic advances towards
Gilgamesh.<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c008'><sup>[546]</sup></a> This data should be sufficient to render
intelligible the rôle of Horus in Plutarch, especially the
violent usage of Isis. Through overpowering the mother
the hero becomes equal to the sun; he reproduces himself.
He wins the strength of the invincible sun, the
power of eternal rejuvenation. We thus understand a
series of representations from the Mithraic myth on the
Heddernheim relief. There we see, first of all, the birth
of Mithra from the top of the tree; the next representation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>shows him carrying the conquered bull (comparable
to the monstrous bull overcome by Gilgamesh). This
bull signifies the concentrated significance of the monster,
the father, who as giant and dangerous animal embodies
the incest prohibition, and agrees with the individual
libido of the sun-hero, which he overcomes by self-sacrifice.
The third picture represents Mithra, when he
grasps the head ornament of the sun, the nimbus. This
act recalls to us, first of all, the violence of Horus towards
Isis; secondly, the Christian basic thought, <em>that those who
have overcome attain the crown of eternal life</em>. On the
fourth picture Sol kneels before Mithra. These last two
representations show plainly that Mithra has taken to
himself the strength of the sun, so that he becomes the
lord of the sun as well. He has conquered “his animal
nature,” the bull. The animal knows no incest prohibition;
man is, therefore, man because he conquers the
incest wish, that is, the animal nature. Thus Mithra has
sacrificed his animal nature, the incest wish, and with that
has overcome the mother, that is to say, “the terrible
death-bringing mother.” A solution is already anticipated
in the Gilgamesh epic through the formal renunciation
of the horrible Ishtar by the hero. The overcoming
of the mother in the Mithraic sacrifice, which had almost
an ascetic character, took place no longer by the archaic
overpowering, but through the renunciation, the sacrifice
of the wish. The primitive thought of incestuous reproduction
through entrance into the mother’s womb had
already been displaced, because man was so far advanced
in domestication that he believed that the eternal life of
the sun is reached, not through the perpetration of incest,
but through the sacrifice of the incest wish. This important
change expressed in the Mithraic mystery finds its
full expression for the first time in the symbol of the
crucified God. A bleeding human sacrifice was hung on
the tree of life for Adam’s sins.<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c008'><sup>[547]</sup></a> The first-born sacrifices
its life to the mother when he suffers, hanging on the
branch, a disgraceful and painful death, a mode of death
which belongs to the most ignominious forms of execution,
which Roman antiquity had reserved for only the lowest
criminal. Thus the hero dies, as if he had committed the
most shameful crime; he does this by returning into the
birth-giving branch of the tree of life, at the same time
paying for his guilt with the pangs of death. The animal
nature is repressed most powerfully in this deed of the
highest courage and the greatest renunciation; therefore,
a greater salvation is to be expected for humanity, because
such a deed alone seems appropriate to expiate
Adam’s guilt.</p>

<p>BULL-SACRIFICE OF MITHRA</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>As has already been mentioned, the hanging of the
sacrifice on the tree is a generally widespread ritual custom,
Germanic examples being especially abundant. The
ritual consists in the sacrifice being pierced by a spear.<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c008'><sup>[548]</sup></a>
Thus it is said of Odin (Edda, Havamal):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I know that I hung on the windswept tree</div>

      <div class='line'>Wounded by a spear, dedicated to Odin</div>
      <div class='line'>I myself to myself.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The hanging of the sacrifice to the cross also occurred
in America prior to its discovery. Müller<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c008'><sup>[549]</sup></a> mentions the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Fejervaryian manuscript (a Mexican hieroglyphic kodex),
at the conclusion of which there is a colossal cross, in the
middle of which there hangs a bleeding divinity. Equally
interesting is the cross of Palenque;<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c008'><sup>[550]</sup></a> up above is a
bird, on either side two human figures, who look at the
cross and hold a child against it either for sacrifice or
baptism. The old Mexicans are said to have invoked the
favor of Centeotls, “the daughter of heaven and the
goddess of wheat,” every spring by nailing upon the cross
a youth or a maiden and by shooting the sacrifice with
arrows.<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c008'><sup>[551]</sup></a> The name of the Mexican cross signifies
“tree of our life or flesh.”<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c008'><sup>[552]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>An effigy from the Island of Philae represents Osiris
in the form of a crucified god, wept over by Isis and
Nephthys, the sister consort.<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c008'><sup>[553]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The meaning of the cross is certainly not limited to
the tree of life, as has already been shown. Just as the
tree of life has also a phallic sub-meaning (as libido symbol),
so there is a further significance to the cross than
life and immortality.<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c008'><sup>[554]</sup></a> Müller uses it as a sign of rain
and of fertility, because it appears among the Indians
distinctly as a magic charm of fertility. It goes without
saying, therefore, that it plays a rôle in the sun cult. It
is also noteworthy that the sign of the cross is an important
sign for the keeping away of all evil, like the ancient
gesture of Manofica. The phallic amulets also serve the
same purpose. Zöckler appears to have overlooked the
fact that the phallic Crux Ansata is the same cross which
has flourished in countless examples in the soil of antiquity.
Copies of this Crux Ansata are found in many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>places, and almost every collection of antiquities possesses
one or more specimens.<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c008'><sup>[555]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, it must be mentioned that the form of the
human body is imitated in the cross as of a man with
arms outspread. It is remarkable that in early Christian
representations Christ is not nailed to the cross, but
stands before it with arms outstretched.<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c008'><sup>[556]</sup></a> Maurice<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c008'><sup>[557]</sup></a>
gives a striking basis for this interpretation when he says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is a fact not less remarkable than well attested, that the
Druids in their groves were accustomed to select the most stately
and beautiful tree as an emblem of the deity they adored, and
cutting off the side branches, they affixed two of the largest of
them to the highest part of the trunk, in such a manner that those
branches extended on each side like the arms of a man, and together
with the body presented the appearance of a huge cross;
and in the bark in several places was also inscribed the letter <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τ</span>
(tau).”<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c008'><sup>[558]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“The tree of knowledge” of the Hindoo Dschaina
sect assumes human form; it was represented as a mighty,
thick trunk in the form of a human head, from the top
of which grew out two longer branches hanging down at
the sides and one short, vertical, uprising branch crowned
by a bud or blossom-like thickening.<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c008'><sup>[559]</sup></a> Robertson in
his “Evangelical Myths” mentions that in the Assyrian
system there exists the representation of the divinity in
the form of a cross, in which the vertical beam corresponds
to a human form and the horizontal beam to a
pair of conventionalized wings. Old Grecian idols such,
for example, as were found in large numbers in Aegina
have a similar character, an immoderately long head and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>arms slightly raised, wing-shaped, and in front distinct
breasts.<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c008'><sup>[560]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I must leave it an open question as to whether the
symbol of the cross has any relation to the two pieces
of wood in the religious fire production, as is frequently
claimed. It does appear, however, as if the cross symbol
actually still possessed the significance of “union,” for
this idea belongs to the fertility charm, and especially to
the thought of eternal rebirth, which is most intimately
bound up with the cross. The thought of “union,” expressed
by the symbol of the cross, is met with in
“Timaios” of Plato, where the world soul is conceived
as stretched out between heaven and earth in the form
of an X (Chi); hence in the form of a “St. Andrew’s
cross.” When we now learn, furthermore, that the
world soul contains in itself <em>the world as a body</em>, then this
picture inevitably reminds us of the mother.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<cite>Dialogues of Plato.</cite> Jowett, Vol. II, page 528.)</p>

<p class='c017'>“And in the center he put the soul, which he diffused through
the whole, and also spread over all the body round about, and
he made one solitary and only heaven, a circle moving in a circle,
having such excellence as to be able to hold converse with itself,
and needing no other friendship or acquaintance. Having these
purposes in view he created the world to be a blessed god.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This highest degree of inactivity and freedom from
desire, symbolized by the <em>being enclosed within itself</em>, signifies
divine blessedness. The only human prototype of
this conception is the child in the mother’s womb, or
rather more, the adult man in the continuous embrace of
the mother, from whom he originates. Corresponding to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>this mythologic-philosophic conception, the enviable Diogenes
inhabited a tub, thus giving mythologic expression
to the blessedness and resemblance to the Divine in his
freedom from desire. Plato says as follows of the bond
of the world soul to the world body:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Now God did not make the soul after the body, although we
have spoken of them in this order; for when he put them together
he would never have allowed that the elder should serve the
younger, but this is what we say at random, because we ourselves
too are very largely affected by chance. Whereas he made the
soul in origin and excellence prior to and older than the body,
to be the ruler and mistress, of whom the body was to be the
subject.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems conceivable from other indications that the
conception of the soul in general is a derivative of the
mother-imago, that is to say, a symbolic designation for
the amount of libido remaining in the mother-imago.
(Compare the Christian representation of the soul as the
bride of Christ.) The further development of the world
soul in “Timaios” takes place in an obscure fashion in
mystic numerals. When the mixture was completed the
following occurred:</p>

<p class='c017'>“This entire compound he divided lengthways into two parts,
which he joined to one another at the center like the figure of
an X.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This passage approaches very closely the division and
union of Atman, who, after the division, is compared to
a man and a woman who hold each other in an embrace.
Another passage is worth mentioning:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“After the entire union of the soul had taken place, according
to the master’s mind, he formed all that is corporeal within this,
and joined it together so as to penetrate it throughout.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, I refer to my remarks about the maternal
meaning of the world soul in Plotinus, in Chapter II.</p>

<p class='c007'>A similar detachment of the symbol of the cross from a
concrete figure we find among the Muskhogean Indians,
who stretch above the surface of the water (pond or
stream) two ropes crosswise and at the point of intersection
throw into the water fruits, oil and precious stones as
a sacrifice.<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c008'><sup>[561]</sup></a> Here the divinity is evidently the water, not
the cross, which designates the place of sacrifice only,
through the point of intersection. The sacrifice at the
place of union indicates why this symbol was a primitive
charm of fertility,<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c008'><sup>[562]</sup></a> why we meet it so frequently in the
prechristian era among the goddesses of love (mother
goddesses), especially among the Egyptians in Isis and
the sun-god. We have already discussed the continuous
union of these two divinities. As the cross (Tau [Τ],
Crux Ansata) always recurs in the hand of Tum, the
supreme God, the hegemon of the Ennead, it may not be
superfluous to say something more of the destination of
Tum. The Tum of On-Heliopolis bears the name “the
father of his mother”; what that means needs no explanation;
Jusas or Nebit-Hotpet, the goddess joined to
him, <em>was called sometimes the mother, sometimes the
daughter, sometimes the wife of the god</em>. The day of
the beginning of autumn is designated in the Heliopolitan
inscriptions as the “festival of the goddess Jusasit,” as
“the arrival of the sister for the purpose of uniting with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>her father.” It is the day in which “the goddess Mehnit
completes her work, so that the god Osiris may enter
into the left eye.” (By which the moon is meant.<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c008'><sup>[563]</sup></a>)
The day is also called the filling up of the sacred eye
with its needs. The heavenly cow with the moon eye,
the cow-headed Isis, takes to herself in the autumn
equinox the seed which procreates Horus. (Moon as
keeper of the seed.) The “eye” evidently represents
the genitals, as in the myth of Indra, who had to bear
spread over his whole body the likeness of Yoni (vulva),
on account of a Bathsheba outrage, but was so far pardoned
by the gods that the disgraceful likeness of Yoni
was changed into eyes.<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c008'><sup>[564]</sup></a> The “pupil” in the eye is a
child. The great god becomes a child again; he enters
the mother’s womb in order to renew himself.<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c008'><sup>[565]</sup></a> In a
hymn it is said:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thy mother, the heavens, stretches forth her arms to thee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In another place it is said:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thou shinest, oh father of the gods, upon the back of thy
mother, daily thy mother takes thee in her arms. When thou
illuminatest the dwelling of night, thou unitest with thy mother,
the heavens.”<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c008'><sup>[566]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Tum of Pitum-Heliopolis not only bears the Crux
Ansata as a symbol, but also has this sign as his most
frequent surname, that is, ān<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χ</span> or ān<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χ</span>i, which means
“life” or “the living.” He is chiefly honored as the
demon serpent, Agatho, of whom it is said, “The holy
demon serpent Agatho goes forth from the city Nezi.”
The snake, on account of casting its skin, is the symbol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of renewal, as is the scarabæus, a symbol of the sun, of
whom it is said that he, being of masculine sex only, reproduces
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The name Chnum (another name for Tum, always
meaning “the sun-god”) comes from the verb <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χ</span>num,
which means “to bind together, to unite.”<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c008'><sup>[567]</sup></a> Chnum
appears chiefly as the potter, the moulder of his egg.
The cross seems, therefore, to be an extraordinarily condensed
symbol; its supreme meaning is that of the tree
of life, and, therefore, is a symbol of the mother. The
symbolization in a human form is, therefore, intelligible.
The phallic forms of the Crux Ansata belong to the abstract
meaning of “life” and “fertility,” as well as to
the meaning of “union,” which we can now very properly
interpret as <em>cohabitation with the mother for the purpose
of renewal</em>.<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c008'><sup>[568]</sup></a> It is, therefore, not only a very touching
but also a very significant naïve symbolism when Mary,
in an Old English lament of the Virgin,<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c008'><sup>[569]</sup></a> accuses the cross
of being a false tree, which unjustly and without reason
destroyed “the pure fruit of her body, her gentle birdling,”
with a poisonous draught, the draught of death,
which is destined only for the guilty descendants of the
sinner Adam. Her son was not a sharer in that guilt.
(Compare with this the cunning of Isis with the fatal
draught of love.) Mary laments:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Cross, thou art the evil stepmother of my son, so high hast
thou hung him that I cannot even kiss his feet! Cross, thou art
my mortal enemy, thou hast slain my little blue bird!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The holy cross answers:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“Woman, I thank thee for my honor: thy splendid fruit, which
now I bear, shines as a red blossom.<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c008'><sup>[570]</sup></a> Not alone to save thee
but to save the whole world this precious flower blooms in thee.”<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c008'><sup>[571]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Santa Crux says of the relation to each other of the
two mothers (Isis in the morning and Isis in the evening):</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thou hast been crowned as Queen of Heaven on account of
the child, which thou hast borne. But I shall appear as the shining
relic to the whole world, at the day of judgment. I shall then
raise my lament for thy divine son innocently slain upon me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the murderous mother of death unites with the
mother of life in bringing forth a child. In their lament
for the dying God, and as outward token of their union,
Mary kisses the cross, and is reconciled to it.<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c008'><sup>[572]</sup></a> The
naïve Egyptian antiquity has preserved for us the union
of the contrasting tendencies in the mother idea of Isis.
Naturally this imago is merely a symbol of the libido of
the son for the mother, and describes the conflict between
love and incest resistance. The criminal incestuous
purpose of the son appears projected as criminal cunning
in the mother-imago. The separation of the son from
the mother signifies the separation of man from the
generic consciousness of animals, from that infantile
archaic thought characterized by the absence of individual
consciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was only the power of the incest prohibition which
created the self-conscious individual, who formerly had
been thoughtlessly one with the tribe, and in this way
alone did the idea of individual and final death become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>possible. Thus through the sin of Adam death came into
the world. This, as is evident, is expressed figuratively,
that is, in contrast form. The mother’s defence against
the incest appears to the son as a malicious act, which
delivers him over to the fear of death. This conflict faces
us in the Gilgamesh epic in its original freshness and
passion, where also the incest wish is projected onto the
mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>The neurotic who cannot leave the mother has good
reasons; the fear of death holds him there. It seems as
if no idea and no word were strong enough to express
the meaning of this. Entire religions were constructed
in order to give words to the immensity of this conflict.
This struggle for expression which continued down
through the centuries certainly cannot have its source
in the restricted realm of the vulgar conception of incest.
Rather one must understand the law which is ultimately
expressed as “Incest prohibition” as coercion to domestication,
and consider the religious systems as institutions
which first receive, then organize and gradually sublimate,
the motor forces of the animal nature not immediately
available for cultural purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>We will now return to the visions of Miss Miller.
Those now following need no further detailed discussion.
The next vision is the image of a “purple bay.” The
symbolism of the sea connects smoothly with that which
precedes. One might think here in addition of the
reminiscences of the Bay of Naples, which we came across
in Part I. In the sequence of the whole, however, we
must not overlook the significance of the “bay.” In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>French it is called <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une baie</span></i>, which probably corresponds
to a bay in the English text. It might be worth
while here to glance at the etymological side of this
idea. Bay is generally used for something which is open,
just as the Catalonian word <i><span lang="ca" xml:lang="ca">badia</span></i> (<em>bai</em>) comes from
<i><span lang="ca" xml:lang="ca">badar</span></i>, “to open.” In French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bayer</span></i> means “to have the
mouth open, to gape.” Another word for the same is
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meerbusen</span></i>, “bay or gulf”; Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sinus</span></i>, and a third word
is golf (gulf), which in French stands in closest relation
to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouffre</span></i> = abyss. Golf is derived from “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόλπος</span>,”<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c008'><sup>[573]</sup></a>
which also means “bosom” and “womb,” “mother-womb,”
also “vagina.” It can also mean a fold of a
dress or pocket; it may also mean a deep valley between
high mountains. These expressions clearly show what
primitive ideas lie at their base. They render intelligible
Goethe’s choice of words at that place where Faust wishes
to follow the sun with winged desire in order in the everlasting
day “to drink its eternal light”:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The mountain chain with all its gorges deep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would then no more impede my godlike motion;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now before mine eyes expands the ocean,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all its bays, in shining sleep!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Faust’s desire, like that of every hero, inclines towards
the mysteries of rebirth, of immortality; therefore, his
course leads to the sea, and down into the monstrous
jaws of death, the horror and narrowness of which at
the same time signify the new day.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Out on the open ocean speeds my dreaming:</div>

      <div class='line'>’Tis time, through deeds this word of truth to thunder;</div>
      <div class='line'>That with the height of God’s Man’s dignity may vie!</div>

      <div class='line'>Though Nothingness should be the certain swift conclusion!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It sounds like a confirmation, when the succeeding vision
of Miss Miller’s is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une falaise à pic</span></i>, “a steep, precipitous
cliff.” (Compare <em>gouffre</em>.) The entire series of
individual visions is completed, as the author observes,
by a confusion of sounds, somewhat resembling “wa-ma,
wa-ma.” This has a very primitive, barbaric sound.
Since we learn from the author nothing of the subjective
roots of this sound, nothing is left us but the suspicion
that this sound might be considered, taken in connection
with the whole, as a slight mutilation of the well-known
call ma-ma.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>
  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE BATTLE FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE MOTHER</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There now comes a pause in the production of visions
by Miss Miller; then the activity of the unconscious is
resumed very energetically.</p>

<p class='c007'>A forest with trees and bushes appears.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the discussions in the preceding chapter, there is
need only of a hint that the symbol of the forest coincides
essentially with the meaning of the holy tree. The holy
tree is found generally in a sacred forest enclosure or in
the garden of Paradise. The sacred grove often takes
the place of the taboo tree and assumes all the attributes
of the latter. The erotic symbolism of the garden is
generally known. The forest, like the tree, has mythologically
a maternal significance. In the vision which now
follows, the forest furnishes the stage upon which the
dramatic representation of the end of Chiwantopel is
played. This act, therefore, takes place in or near the
mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, I will give the beginning of the drama as it is in
the original text, up to the first attempt at sacrifice. At
the beginning of the next chapter the reader will find the
continuation, the monologue and the sacrificial scene.
The drama begins as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>“The personage Chiwantopel, came from the south, on horseback;
around him a cloak of vivid colors, red, blue and white. An
Indian in a costume of doe skin, covered with beads and ornamented
with feathers advances, squats down and prepares to let fly an
arrow at Chiwantopel. The latter presents his breast in an attitude
of defiance, and the Indian, fascinated by that sight, slinks away
and disappears within the forest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero, Chiwantopel, appears on horseback. This
fact seems of importance, because as the further course
of the drama shows (see Chapter VIII) the horse plays
no indifferent rôle, but suffers the same death as the hero,
and is even called “faithful brother” by the latter.
These allusions point to a remarkable similarity between
horse and rider. There seems to exist an intimate connection
between the two, which guides them to the same
destiny. We already have seen that the symbolization of
“the libido in resistance” through the “terrible mother”
in some places runs parallel with the horse.<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c008'><sup>[574]</sup></a> Strictly
speaking, it would be incorrect to say that the horse is, or
means, the mother. The mother idea is a libido symbol,
and the horse is also a libido symbol, and at some points
the two symbols intersect in their significances. The common
feature of the two ideas lies in the libido, especially
in the libido repressed from incest. The hero and the
horse appear to us in this setting like an artistic formation
of the idea of humanity with its repressed libido, whereby
the horse acquires the significance of the animal unconscious,
which appears domesticated and subjected to the
will of man. Agni upon the ram, Wotan upon Sleipneir,
Ahuramazda upon Angromainyu,<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c008'><sup>[575]</sup></a> Jahwe upon the monstrous
seraph, Christ upon the ass,<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c008'><sup>[576]</sup></a> Dionysus upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>ass, Mithra upon the horse, Men upon the human-footed
horse, Freir upon the golden-bristled boar, etc., are
parallel representations. The chargers of mythology are
always invested with great significance; they very often
appear anthropomorphized. Thus, Men’s horse has
human forelegs; Balaam’s ass, human speech; the retreating
bull, upon whose back Mithra springs in order to
strike him down, is, according to a Persian legend, actually
the God himself. The mock crucifix of the Palatine
represents the crucified with an ass’s head, perhaps in
reference to the ancient legend that in the temple of
Jerusalem the image of an ass was worshipped. As
Drosselbart (horse’s mane) Wotan is half-human,
half-horse.<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c008'><sup>[577]</sup></a> An old German riddle very prettily shows
this unity between horse and horseman.<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c008'><sup>[578]</sup></a> “Who are the
two, who travel to Thing? Together they have three
eyes, ten feet<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c008'><sup>[579]</sup></a> and one tail; and thus they travel over
the land.” Legends ascribe properties to the horse, which
psychologically belong to the unconscious of man; horses
are clairvoyant and clairaudient; they show the way when
the lost wanderer is helpless; they have mantic powers.
In the Iliad the horse prophesies evil. They hear the
words which the corpse speaks when it is taken to the
grave—words which men cannot hear. Cæsar learned
from his human-footed horse (probably taken from the
identification of Cæsar with the Phrygian Men) that he
was to conquer the world. An ass prophesied to Augustus
the victory of Actium. The horse also sees phantoms.
All these things correspond to typical manifestations of
the unconscious. Therefore, it is perfectly intelligible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>that the horse, as the image of the wicked animal component
of man, has manifold connections with the devil.
The devil has a horse’s foot; in certain circumstances a
horse’s form. At crucial moments he suddenly shows a
cloven foot (proverbial) in the same way as in the abduction
of Hadding, Sleipneir suddenly looked out from behind
Wotan’s mantle.<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c008'><sup>[580]</sup></a> Just as the nightmare rides on
the sleeper, so does the devil, and, therefore, it is said
that those who have nightmares are ridden by the devil.
In Persian lore the devil is the steed of God. The devil,
like all evil things, represents sexuality. Witches have
intercourse with him, in which case he appears in the
form of a goat or horse. The unmistakably phallic
nature of the devil is communicated to the horse as well;
hence this symbol occurs in connections where this is the
only meaning which would furnish an explanation. It is
to be mentioned that Loki generates in the form of a
horse, just as does the devil when in horse’s form, as an
old fire god. Thus the lightning was represented theriomorphically
as a horse.<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c008'><sup>[581]</sup></a> An uneducated hysteric told me
that as a child she had suffered from extreme fear of
thunder, because every time the lightning flashed she saw
immediately afterwards a huge black horse reaching upwards
as far as the sky.<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c008'><sup>[582]</sup></a> It is said in a legend that the
devil, as the divinity of lightning, casts a horse’s foot
(lightning) upon the roofs. In accordance with the
primitive meaning of thunder as fertilizer of the earth,
the phallic meaning is given both to lightning and the
horse’s foot. In mythology the horse’s foot really has
the phallic function as in this dream. An uneducated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>patient who originally had been violently forced to coitus
by her husband very often dreams (after separation)
that a wild horse springs upon her and kicks her in the
abdomen with his hind foot. Plutarch has given us the
following words of a prayer from the Dionysus orgies:</p>

<p class='c017'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐλθεῖν ἥρως Διόνυσε Ἄλιον ἐς ναὸν ἁγνὸν σὺν Χαρίτεσσιν
ἐς ναὸν τῷ βοέῳ ποδὶ θύων, ἄξιε ταῦρε, ἄξιε ταῦρε.</span><a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c008'><sup>[583]</sup></a><a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c008'><sup>[584]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Pegasus with his foot strikes out of the earth the
spring Hippocrene. Upon a Corinthian statue of Bellerophon,
which was also a fountain, the water flowed out
from the horse’s hoof. Balder’s horse gave rise to a
spring through his kick. Thus the horse’s foot is the
dispenser of fruitful moisture.<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c008'><sup>[585]</sup></a> A legend of lower
Austria, told by Jaehns, informs us that a gigantic man
on a white horse is sometimes seen riding over the mountains.
This means a speedy rain. In the German legend
the goddess of birth, Frau Holle, appears on horseback.
Pregnant women near confinement are prone to give oats
to a white horse from their aprons and to pray him to
give them a speedy delivery. It was originally the custom
for the horse to rub against the woman’s genitals. The
horse (like the ass) had in general the significance of a
priapic animal.<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c008'><sup>[586]</sup></a> Horse’s tracks are idols dispensing
blessing and fertility. Horse’s tracks established a claim,
and were of significance in determining boundaries, like
the priaps of Latin antiquity. Like the phallic Dactyli,
a horse opened the mineral riches of the Harz Mountains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>with his hoof. The horseshoe, an equivalent for
horse’s foot,<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c008'><sup>[587]</sup></a> brings luck and has apotropaic meaning.
In the Netherlands an entire horse’s foot is hung up in
the stable to ward against sorcery. The analogous effect
of the phallus is well known; hence the phalli at the
gates. In particular the horse’s leg turned lightning aside,
according to the principle “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">similia similibus.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Horses also symbolize the wind, that is to say, the
tertium comparationis is again the libido symbol. The
German legend recognizes the wind as the wild huntsman
in pursuit of the maiden. Stormy regions frequently
derive their names from horses, as the White Horse
Mountain of the Lüneburger heath. The centaurs are
typical wind gods, and have been represented as such by
Böcklin’s artistic intuition.<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c008'><sup>[588]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Horses also signify fire and light. The fiery horses of
Helios are an example. The horses of Hector are called
Xanthos (yellow, bright), Podargos (swift-footed),
Lampos (shining) and Aithon (burning). A very pronounced
fire symbolism was represented by the mystic
Quadriga, mentioned by Dio Chrysostomus. The supreme
God always drives his chariot in a circle. Four
horses are harnessed to the chariot. The horse driven
on the periphery moves very quickly. He has a shining
coat, and bears upon it the signs of the planets and the
Zodiac.<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c008'><sup>[589]</sup></a> This is a representation of the rotary fire of
heaven. The second horse moves more slowly, and is
illuminated only on one side. The third moves still more
slowly, and the fourth rotates around himself. But once
the outer horse set the second horse on fire with his fiery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>breath, and the third flooded the fourth with his streaming
sweat. Then the horses dissolve and pass over into
the substance of the strongest and most fiery, which now
becomes the charioteer. The horses also represent the
four elements. The catastrophe signifies the conflagration
of the world and the deluge, whereupon the division
of the God into many parts ceases, and the divine unity
is restored.<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c008'><sup>[590]</sup></a> Doubtless the Quadriga may be understood
astronomically as a <em>symbol of time</em>. We already saw in
the first part that the stoic representation of Fate is a
fire symbol. It is, therefore, a logical continuation of
the thought, when time, closely related to the conception
of destiny, exhibits this same libido symbolism. Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad,
i: 1, says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The morning glow verily is the head of the sacrificial horse,
the sun his eye, the wind his breath, the all-spreading fire his
mouth, the year is the belly of the sacrificial horse. The sky is
his back, the atmosphere the cavern of his body, the earth the vault
of his belly. The poles are his sides, in between the poles his ribs,
the seasons his limbs, the months and fortnights his joints. Days
and nights are his feet, stars his bones, clouds his flesh. The food
he digests is the deserts, the rivers are his veins, the mountains his
liver and lungs, the herbs and trees his hair; the rising sun is his
fore part, the setting sun his after part. The ocean is his kinsman,
the sea his cradle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The horse undoubtedly here stands for a time symbol,
and also for the entire world. We come across in the
Mithraic religion, a strange God of Time, Aion,
called Kronos or Deus Leontocephalus, because his
stereotyped representation is a lion-headed man, who,
standing in a rigid attitude, is encoiled by a snake, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>head projects forward from behind over the lion’s
head. The figure holds in each hand a key, on the chest
rests a thunderbolt, upon his back are the four wings of
the wind; in addition to that, the figure sometimes bears
the Zodiac on his body. Additional attributes are a cock
and implements. In the Carolingian psalter of Utrecht,
which is based upon ancient models, the Sæculum-Aion is
represented as a naked man with a snake in his hand. As
is suggested by the name of the divinity, he is a symbol
of time, most interestingly composed from libido
symbols. The lion, the zodiac sign of the greatest summer
heat,<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c008'><sup>[591]</sup></a> is the symbol of the most mighty desire.
(“My soul roars with the voice of a hungry lion,” says
Mechthild of Magdeburg.) In the Mithra mystery the
serpent is often antagonistic to the lion, corresponding to
that very universal myth of the battle of the sun with the
dragon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Tum is even designated
as a he-cat, because as such he fought the snake,
Apophis. The encoiling also means the engulfing, the
entering into the mother’s womb. Thus time is defined
by the rising and setting of the sun, that is to say, through
the death and renewal of the libido. The addition of the
cock again suggests time, and the addition of implements
suggests the creation through time. (“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Durée créatrice</span>,”
Bergson.) Oromazdes and Ahriman were produced
through Zrwanakarana, the “infinitely long duration.”
Time, this empty and purely formal concept, is expressed
in the mysteries by transformations of the creative power,
the libido. Macrobius says:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leonis capite monstratur praesens tempus—quia conditio
ejus valida fervensque est.</span>”<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c008'><sup>[592]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Philo of Alexandria has a better understanding:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tempus ab hominibus pessimis putatur deus volentibus Ens essentiale
abscondere—pravis hominibus tempus putatur causa rerum
mundi, sapientibus vero et optimis non tempus sed Deus.</span>”<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c008'><sup>[593]</sup></a><a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c008'><sup>[594]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In Firdusi<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c008'><sup>[595]</sup></a> time is often the symbol of fate, the
libido nature of which we have already learned to recognize.
The Hindoo text mentioned above includes still
more—its symbol of the horse contains the whole world;
his kinsman and his cradle is the sea, the mother, similar
to the world soul, the maternal significance of which we
have seen above. Just as Aion represents the libido in
an embrace, that is to say, in the state of death and of
rebirth, so here the cradle of the horse is the sea, i. e.
the libido is in the mother, dying and rising again, like
the symbol of the dying and resurrected Christ, who
hangs like ripe fruit upon the tree of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already seen that the horse is connected
through Ygdrasil with the symbolism of the tree. The
horse is also a “tree of death”; thus in the Middle Ages
the funeral pyre was called St. Michael’s horse, and the
neo-Persian word for coffin means “wooden horse.”<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c008'><sup>[596]</sup></a>
The horse has also the rôle of psycho-pompos; he is the
steed to conduct the souls to the other world—horsewomen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>fetch the souls (Valkyries). Neo-Greek songs
represent Charon on a horse. These definitions obviously
lead to the mother symbolism. The Trojan horse was
the only means by which the city could be conquered; because
only he who has entered the mother and been reborn
is an invincible hero. The Trojan horse is a magic
charm, like the “Nodfyr,” which also serves to overcome
necessity. The formula evidently reads, “In order to
overcome the difficulty, thou must commit incest, and
once more be born from thy mother.” It appears that
striking a nail into the sacred tree signifies something very
similar. The “Stock im Eisen” in Vienna seems to have
been such a palladium.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still another symbolic form is to be considered. Occasionally
the devil rides upon a three-legged horse. The
Goddess of Death, Hel, in time of pestilence, also rides
upon a three-legged horse.<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c008'><sup>[597]</sup></a> The gigantic ass, which is
three-legged, stands in the heavenly rain lake Vourukasha;
his urine purifies the water of the lake, and from
his roar all useful animals become pregnant and all harmful
animals miscarry. The Triad further points to the
phallic significance. The contrasting symbolism of Hel is
blended into one conception in the ass of Vourukasha.
The libido is fructifying as well as destroying.</p>

<p class='c007'>These definitions, as a whole, plainly reveal the fundamental
features. The horse is a libido symbol, partly of
phallic, partly of maternal significance, like the tree. It
represents the libido in this application, that is, the libido
repressed through the incest prohibition.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>In the Miller drama an Indian approaches the hero,
ready to shoot an arrow at him. Chiwantopel, however,
with a proud gesture, exposes his breast to the enemy.
This idea reminds the author of the scene between Cassius
and Brutus in Shakespeare’s “Julius Cæsar.” A misunderstanding
has arisen between the two friends, when
Brutus reproaches Cassius for withholding from him the
money for the legions. Cassius, irritable and angry,
breaks out into the complaint:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,</div>
      <div class='line'>Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,</div>
      <div class='line'>For Cassius is a-weary of the world:</div>
      <div class='line'>Hated by one he loves: braved by his brother:</div>
      <div class='line'>Check’d like a bondman; <em>all his faults observed</em>:</div>
      <div class='line'>Set in a note-book, learn’d and conn’d by rote,</div>
      <div class='line'>To cast into my teeth. O I could weep</div>
      <div class='line'>My spirit from mine eyes!—There is my dagger,</div>
      <div class='line'>And here my naked breast; within, a heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Dearer than Plutus’ mine, richer than gold:</div>
      <div class='line'>If that thou beest a Roman, take it forth:</div>
      <div class='line'>I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>Strike, as thou didst at Cæsar; for I know</div>
      <div class='line'>When thou didst hate him worst, thou lov’dst him better</div>
      <div class='line'>Than ever thou lov’dst Cassius.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The material here would be incomplete without mentioning
the fact that this speech of Cassius shows many
analogies to the agonized delirium of Cyrano (compare
Part I), only Cassius is far more theatrical and overdrawn.
Something childish and hysterical is in his manner.
Brutus does not think of killing him, but administers
a very chilling rebuke in the following dialogue:</p>

      <div class='line in9'>He’ll think your mother chides and leave you so.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The analytic interpretation of Cassius’s irritability
plainly reveals that at these moments he identifies himself
with the mother, and his conduct, therefore, is truly feminine,
as his speech demonstrates most excellently. For his
womanish love-seeking and desperate subjection under
the proud masculine will of Brutus calls forth the friendly
remark of the latter, that Cassius is yoked with a lamb,
that is to say, has something very weak in his character,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>which is derived from the mother. One recognizes in
this without any difficulty the analytic hall-marks of an
infantile disposition, which, as always, is characterized
by a prevalence of the parent-imago, here the mother-imago.
An infantile individual is infantile because he has
freed himself insufficiently, or not at all, from the childish
environment, that is, from his adaptation to his
parents. Therefore, on one side, he reacts falsely towards
the world, as a child towards his parents, always demanding
love and immediate reward for his feelings; on the
other side, on account of the close connection to the parents,
he identifies himself with them. The infantile individual
behaves like the father and mother. He is not in
a condition to live for himself and to find the place to
which he belongs. Therefore, Brutus very justly takes
it for granted that the “mother chides” in Cassius, not
he himself. The psychologically valuable fact which we
gather here is the information <em>that Cassius is infantile
and identified</em> with the mother. The hysterical behavior
is due to the circumstance that Cassius is still, in part, a
lamb, and <em>an innocent and entirely harmless child</em>. He
remains, as far as his emotional life is concerned, still far
behind himself. This we often see among people who,
as masters, apparently govern life and fellow-creatures;
they have remained children in regard to the demands of
their love nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The figures of the Miller dramas, being children of the
creator’s phantasy, depict, as is natural, those traits of
character which belong to the author. The hero, the wish
figure, is represented as most distinguished, because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>hero always combines in himself all wished-for ideals.
Cyrano’s attitude is certainly beautiful and impressive;
Cassius’s behavior has a theatrical effect. Both heroes
prepare to die effectively, in which attempt Cyrano succeeds.
This attitude betrays a wish for death in the unconscious
of our author, the meaning of which we have
already discussed at length as the motive for her poem
of the moth. The wish of young girls to die is only an
indirect expression, which remains a pose, even in case
of real death, for death itself can be a pose. Such an
outcome merely adds beauty and value to the pose under
certain conditions. That the highest summit of life is
expressed through the symbolism of death is a well-known
fact; for creation beyond one’s self means personal death.
The coming generation is the end of the preceding one.
This symbolism is frequent in erotic speech. The lascivious
speech between Lucius and the wanton servant-maid
in Apuleius (“Metamorphoses,” lib. ii: 32) is one of the
clearest examples:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proeliare, inquit, et fortiter proeliare: nec enim tibi cedam,
nec terga vortam. Cominus in aspectum, si vir es, dirige; et
grassare naviter, et occide moriturus. Hodierna pugna non habet
missionem.—Simul ambo corruimus inter mutuos amplexus animas
anhelantes.</span>”<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c008'><sup>[598]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This symbolism is extremely significant, because it
shows how easily a contrasting expression originates and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>how equally intelligible and characteristic such an expression
is. The proud gesture with which the hero offers
himself to death may very easily be an indirect expression
which challenges the pity or sympathy of the other, and
thus is doomed to the calm analytic reduction to which
Brutus proceeds. The behavior of Chiwantopel is also
suspicious, because the Cassius scene which serves as its
model betrays indiscreetly that the whole affair is merely
infantile and one which owes its origin to an overactive
mother imago. When we compare this piece with the
series of mother symbols brought to light in the previous
chapter, we must say that the Cassius scene merely confirms
once more what we have long supposed, that is to
say, that the motor power of these symbolic visions arises
from an infantile mother transference, that is to say,
from an undetached bond to the mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the drama the libido, in contradistinction to the inactive
nature of the previous symbols, assumes a threatening
activity, a conflict becoming evident, in which the one
part threatens the other with murder. The hero, as the
ideal image of the dreamer, is inclined to die; he does not
fear death. In accordance with the infantile character of
this hero, it would most surely be time for him to take his
departure from the stage, or, in childish language, to die.
Death is to come to him in the form of an arrow-wound.
Considering the fact that heroes themselves are very
often great archers or succumb to an arrow-wound (St.
Sebastian, as an example), it may not be superfluous to
inquire into the meaning of death through an arrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>We read in the biography of the stigmatized nun Katherine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Emmerich<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c008'><sup>[599]</sup></a> the following description of the evidently
neurotic sickness of her heart:</p>

<p class='c017'>“When only in her novitiate, she received as a Christmas
present from the holy Christ a very tormenting heart trouble for
the whole period of her nun’s life. God showed her inwardly
the purpose; it was on account of the decline of the spirit of the
order, especially for the sins of her fellow-sisters. But what
rendered this trouble most painful was the gift which she had
possessed from youth, namely, to see before her eyes the inner
nature of man as he really was. She felt the heart trouble
physically as if her heart was continually pierced by arrows.<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c008'><sup>[600]</sup></a>
These arrows—and this represented the still worse mental suffering—she
recognized as the thoughts, plots, secret speeches,
misunderstandings, scandal and uncharitableness, in which her
fellow-sisters, wholly without reason and unscrupulously, were
engaged against her and her god-fearing way of life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult to be a saint, because even a patient and
long-suffering nature will not readily bear such a violation,
and defends itself in its own way. The companion
of sanctity is temptation, without which no true saint can
live. We know from analytic experience that these
temptations can pass unconsciously, so that only their
equivalents would be produced in consciousness in the
form of symptoms. We know that it is proverbial that
heart and smart (Herz and Schmerz) rhyme. It is a
well-known fact that hysterics put a physical pain in place
of a mental pain. The biographer of Emmerich has comprehended
that very correctly. Only her interpretation of
the pain is, as usual, projected. It is always the others
who secretly assert all sorts of evil things about her, and
this she pretended gave her the pains.<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c008'><sup>[601]</sup></a> The case, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>bears a somewhat different aspect. The very difficult
renunciation of all life’s joys, this death before the
bloom, is generally painful, and especially painful are the
unfulfilled wishes and the attempts of the animal nature to
break through the power of repression. The gossip and
jokes of the sisters very naturally centre around these
most painful things, so that it must appear to the saint
as if her symptoms were caused by this. Naturally, again,
she could not know that gossip tends to assume the rôle
of the unconscious, which, like a clever adversary, always
aims at the actual gaps in our armor.</p>

<p class='c007'>A passage from Gautama Buddha embodies this idea:<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c008'><sup>[602]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A wish earnestly desired</div>
      <div class='line'>Produced by will, and nourished</div>
      <div class='line'>When gradually it must be thwarted,</div>
      <div class='line'>Burrows like an arrow in the flesh.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The wounding and painful arrows do not come from
without through gossip, which only attacks externally,
but they come from ambush, from our own unconscious.
This, rather than anything external, creates the defenseless
suffering. It is our <em>own repressed and unrecognized
desires which fester like arrows in our flesh</em>.<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c008'><sup>[603]</sup></a> In another
connection this was clear to the nun, and that most literally.
It is a well-known fact, and one which needs no
further proof to those who understand, that these mystic
scenes of union with the Saviour generally are intermingled
with an enormous amount of sexual libido.<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c008'><sup>[604]</sup></a> Therefore,
it is not astonishing that the scene of the stigmata
is nothing but an incubation through the Saviour, only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>slightly changed metaphorically, as compared with the
ancient conception of “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">unio mystica</span>,” as cohabitation
with the god. Emmerich relates the following of her
stigmatization:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I had a contemplation of the sufferings of Christ, and implored
him to let me feel with him his sorrows, and prayed five
paternosters to the honor of the five sacred wounds. Lying on
my bed with outstretched arms, I entered into a great sweetness
and into an endless thirst for the torments of Jesus. Then I saw
a light descending upon me: it came obliquely from above. It
was a crucified body, living and transparent, with arms extended,
but without a cross. The wounds shone brighter than the body;
they were five circles of glory, coming forth from the whole glory.
I was enraptured and my heart was moved with great pain and
yet with sweetness from longing to share in the torments of my
Saviour. And my longings for the sorrows of the Redeemer
increased more and more on gazing on his wounds, and passed
from my breast, through my hands, sides and feet to his holy
wounds: then from the hands, then from the sides, then from
the feet of the figure threefold shining red beams ending below
in an arrow, shot forth to my hands, sides and feet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The beams, in accordance with the phallic fundamental
thought, are threefold, terminating below in an arrow-point.<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c008'><sup>[605]</sup></a>
Like Cupid, the sun, too, has its quiver, full of
destroying or fertilizing arrows, sun rays,<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c008'><sup>[606]</sup></a> which possess
phallic meaning. On this significance evidently rests the
Oriental custom of designating brave sons as arrows and
javelins of the parents. “To make sharp arrows” is an
Arabian expression for “to generate brave sons.” The
Psalms declare (cxxvii:4):</p>

<p class='c017'>“Like as the arrows in the hands of the giant; even so are the
young children.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>(Compare with this the remarks previously made
about “boys.”) Because of this significance of the arrow
it is intelligible why the Scythian king Ariantes, when he
wished to prepare a census, demanded an arrow-head
from each man. A similar meaning attaches equally to
the lance. Men are descended from the lance, because
the ash is the mother of lances. Therefore, the men of
the Iron Age are derived from her. The marriage custom
to which Ovid alludes (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comat virgineas hasta
recurva comas</span>”—<em>Fastorum</em>, lib. ii: 560) has already
been mentioned. Kaineus issued a command that his
lance be honored. Pindar relates in the legend of this
Kaineus:</p>

<p class='c017'>“He descended into the depths, splitting the earth with a
straight foot.”<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c008'><sup>[607]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>He is said to have originally been a maiden named
Kainis, who, because of her complaisance, was transformed
into an invulnerable man by Poseidon. Ovid
pictures the battle of the Lapithæ with the invulnerable
Kaineus; how at last they covered him completely with
trees, because they could not otherwise touch him. Ovid
says at this place:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Exitus in dubio est: alii sub inania corpus</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tartara detrusum silvarum mole ferebant,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Abnuit Ampycides: medioque ex aggere fulvis</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vidit avem pennis liquidas exire sub auras.</span>”<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c008'><sup>[608]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>Roscher considers this bird to be the golden plover
(Charadrius pluvialis), which borrows its name from the
fact that it lives in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαράδρα</span>, a crevice in the earth.
By his song he proclaims the approaching rain. Kaineus
was changed into this bird.</p>

<p class='c007'>We see again in this little myth the typical constituents
of the libido myth: original bisexuality, immortality (invulnerability)
through entrance into the mother (splitting
the mother with the foot, and to become covered up)
and resurrection as a bird of the soul and a bringer of
fertility (ascending sun). When this type of hero causes
his lance to be worshipped, it probably means that his
lance is a valid and equivalent expression of himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>From our present standpoint, we understand in a new
sense that passage in Job, which I mentioned in Chapter
IV of the first part of this book:</p>

<p class='c017'>“He has set me up for his mark.</p>

<p class='c017'>“His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
asunder, and doth not spare:—he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He breaketh me with breach upon breach: he runneth upon
me like a giant.”—<cite>Job</cite> xvi:12–13–14.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now we understand this symbolism as an expression
for the soul torment caused by the onslaught of the unconscious
desires. The libido festers in his flesh, a cruel
god has taken possession of him and pierced him with
his painful libidian projectiles, with thoughts, which overwhelmingly
pass through him. (As a dementia præcox
patient once said to me during his recovery: “To-day a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>thought suddenly thrust itself through me.”) This same
idea is found again in Nietzsche in Zarathustra:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>Thou wilt not kill,</div>
      <div class='line'>But torture, torture?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No long-drawn-out explanation is necessary to enable
us to recognize in this comparison the old, universal idea
of the martyred sacrifice of God, which we have met previously
in the Mexican sacrifice of the cross and in the
sacrifice of Odin.<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c008'><sup>[609]</sup></a> This same conception faces us in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>the oft-repeated martyrdom of St. Sebastian, where, in
the delicate-glowing flesh of the young god, all the pain
of renunciation which has been felt by the artist has been
portrayed. An artist always embodies in his artistic work
a portion of the mysteries of his time. In a heightened
degree the same is true of the principal Christian symbol,
the crucified one pierced by the lance, the conception of
the man of the Christian era tormented by his wishes,
crucified and dying in Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is not torment which comes from without, which
befalls mankind; but that he himself is the hunter, murderer,
sacrificer and sacrificial knife is shown us in another
of Nietzsche’s poems, wherein the apparent dualism is
transformed into the soul conflict through the use of the
same symbolism:</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The deadly arrows do not strike the hero from without,
but it is he himself who, in disharmony with himself,
hunts, fights and tortures himself. Within himself will
has turned against will, libido against libido—therefore,
the poet says, “Pierced through thyself,” that is to say,
wounded by his own arrow. Because we have discerned
that the arrow is a libido symbol, the idea of “penetrating
or piercing through” consequently becomes clear to
us. It is a phallic act of union with one’s self, a sort of
self-fertilization (introversion); also a self-violation, a
self-murder; therefore, Zarathustra may call himself his
own hangman, like Odin, who sacrifices himself to Odin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wounding by one’s own arrow means, first of all,
<em>the state of introversion</em>. What this signifies we already
know—the libido sinks into its “own depths” (a well-known
comparison of Nietzsche’s) and finds there below,
in the shadows of the unconscious, the substitute for the
upper world, which it has abandoned: <em>the world of memories</em>
(“’mid a hundred memories”), the strongest and
most influential of which are the early infantile memory
pictures. It is the world of the child, this paradise-like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>state of earliest childhood, from which we are separated
by a hard law. In this subterranean kingdom slumber
sweet feelings of home and the endless hopes of all that
is to be. As Heinrich in the “Sunken Bell,” by Gerhart
Hauptmann, says, in speaking of his miraculous work:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There is a song lost and forgotten,</div>
      <div class='line'>A song of home, a love song of childhood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Brought up from the depths of the fairy well,</div>
      <div class='line'>Known to all, but yet unheard.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>However, as Mephistopheles says, “The danger is
great.” These depths are enticing; they are the mother
and—death. When the libido leaves the bright upper
world, whether from the decision of the individual or
from decreasing life force, then it sinks back into its own
depths, into the source from which it has gushed forth,
and turns back to that point of cleavage, the umbilicus,
through which it once entered into this body. This point
of cleavage is called the mother, because from her comes
the source of the libido. Therefore, when some great
work is to be accomplished, before which weak man recoils,
doubtful of his strength, his libido returns to that
source—and this is the dangerous moment, in which the
decision takes place between annihilation and new life.
If the libido remains arrested in the wonder kingdom of
the inner world,<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c008'><sup>[610]</sup></a> then the man has become for the world
above a phantom, then he is practically dead or desperately
ill.<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c008'><sup>[611]</sup></a> But if the libido succeeds in tearing itself
loose and pushing up into the world above, then a miracle
appears. This journey to the underworld has been a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>fountain of youth, and new fertility springs from his apparent
death. This train of thought is very beautifully
gathered into a Hindoo myth: Once upon a time, Vishnu
sank into an ecstasy (introversion) and during this state
of sleep bore Brahma, who, enthroned upon the lotus
flower, arose from the navel of Vishnu, bringing with
him the Vedas, which he diligently read. (Birth of creative
thought from introversion.) But through Vishnu’s
ecstasy a devouring flood came upon the world. (Devouring
through introversion, symbolizing the danger of entering
into the mother of death.) A demon taking advantage
of the danger, stole the Vedas from Brahma and
hid them in the depths. (Devouring of the libido.)
Brahma roused Vishnu, and the latter, transforming
himself into a fish, plunged into the flood, fought with
the demon (battle with the dragon), conquered him and
recaptured the Vedas. (Treasure obtained with difficulty.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Self-concentration and the strength derived therefrom
correspond to this primitive train of thought. It also
explains numerous sacrificial and magic rites which we
have already fully discussed. Thus the impregnable Troy
falls because the besiegers creep into the belly of a wooden
horse; for he alone is a hero who is reborn from the
mother, like the sun. But the danger of this venture is
shown by the history of Philoctetes, who was the only
one in the Trojan expedition who knew the hidden sanctuary
of Chryse, where the Argonauts had sacrificed already,
and where the Greeks planned to sacrifice in order
to assure a safe ending to their undertaking. Chryse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>was a nymph upon the island of Chryse; according
to the account of the scholiasts in Sophocles’s “Philoctetes,”
this nymph loved Philoctetes, and cursed him because
he spurned her love. This characteristic projection,
which is also met with in the Gilgamesh epic, should be
referred back, as suggested, to the repressed incest wish
of the son, who is represented through the projection as if
the mother had the evil wish, for the refusal of which the
son was given over to death. In reality, however, the son
becomes mortal by separating himself from the mother.
His fear of death, therefore, corresponds to the repressed
wish to turn back to the mother, and causes him to believe
that the mother threatens or pursues him. The
teleological significance of this <em>fear of persecution</em> is evident;
<em>it is to keep son and mother apart</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The curse of Chryse is realized in so far that Philoctetes,
according to one version, when approaching his
altar, injured himself in his foot with one of his own
deadly poisonous arrows, or, according to another version<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c008'><sup>[612]</sup></a>
(this is better and far more abundantly proven),
<em>was bitten in his foot by a poisonous serpent</em>.<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c008'><sup>[613]</sup></a> From
then on he is ailing.<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c008'><sup>[614]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This very typical wound, which also destroyed Rê, is
described in the following manner in an Egyptian hymn:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The ancient of the Gods moved his mouth,</div>
      <div class='line'>He cast his saliva upon the earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what he spat, fell upon the ground.</div>
      <div class='line'>With her hands Isis kneaded that and the soil</div>
      <div class='line'>Which was about it, together:</div>
      <div class='line'>From that she created a venerable worm,</div>
      <div class='line'>And made him like a spear.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>She did not twist him living around her face,</div>
      <div class='line'>But threw him coiled upon the path,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon which the great God wandered at ease</div>
      <div class='line'>Through all his lands.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The venerable God stepped forth radiantly,</div>
      <div class='line'>The gods who served Pharaoh accompanied him,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he proceeded as every day.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then the venerable worm stung him....</div>
      <div class='line'>The divine God opened his mouth</div>
      <div class='line'>And the voice of his majesty echoed even to the sky.</div>
      <div class='line'>And the gods exclaimed: Behold!</div>
      <div class='line'>Thereupon he could not answer,</div>
      <div class='line'>His jaws chattered,</div>
      <div class='line'>All his limbs trembled</div>
      <div class='line'>And the poison gripped his flesh,</div>
      <div class='line'>As the Nile seizes upon the land.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In this hymn Egypt has again preserved for us a primitive
conception of the serpent’s sting. The aging of the
autumn sun as an image of human senility is symbolically
traced back to the mother through the poisoning by the
serpent. The mother is reproached, because her malice
causes the death of the sun-god. The serpent, the primitive
symbol of fear,<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c008'><sup>[615]</sup></a> illustrates the repressed tendency to
turn back to the mother, because the only possibility of
security from death is possessed by the mother, as the
source of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly, only the mother can cure him, sick unto
death, and, therefore, the hymn goes on to depict how the
gods were assembled to take counsel:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And Isis came with her wisdom:</div>
      <div class='line'>Her mouth is full of the breath of life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her words banish sorrow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And her speech animates those who no longer breathe.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>She said: ‘What is that; what is that, divine father?</div>
      <div class='line'>Behold, a worm has brought you sorrow——’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Tell me thy name, divine father,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because the man remains alive, who is called by his name.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Whereupon Rê replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘I am he, who created heaven and earth, and piled up the hills,</div>
      <div class='line'>And created all beings thereon.</div>
      <div class='line'>I am he, who made the water and caused the great flood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who produced the bull of his mother,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who is the procreator,’ etc.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The poison did not depart, it went further,</div>
      <div class='line'>The great God was not cured.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then said Isis to Rê:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Thine is not the name thou hast told me.</div>
      <div class='line'>Tell me true that the poison may leave thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>For he whose name is spoken will live.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Finally Rê decides to speak his true name. He is approximately
healed (imperfect composition of Osiris);
but he has lost his power, and finally he retreats to the
heavenly cow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The poisonous worm is, if one may speak in this way,
a “negative” phallus, a deadly, not an animating, form
of libido; therefore, a wish for death, instead of a wish
for life. The “true name” is soul and magic power;
hence a symbol of libido. What Isis demands is the retransference
of the libido to the mother goddess. This
request is fulfilled literally, for the aged god turns back
to the divine cow, the symbol of the mother.<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c008'><sup>[616]</sup></a> This symbolism
is clear from our previous explanations. The
onward urging, living libido which rules the consciousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>of the son, demands separation from the mother.
The longing of the child for the mother is a hindrance
on the path to this, taking the form of a psychologic resistance,
which is expressed empirically in the neurosis by
all manners of fears, that is to say, the fear of life. The
more a person withdraws from adaptation to reality, and
falls into slothful inactivity, the greater becomes his
anxiety (cum grano salis), which everywhere besets him
at each point as a hindrance upon his path. The fear
springs from the mother, that is to say, from the longing
to go back to the mother, which is opposed to the adaptation
to reality. This is the way in which the mother has
become apparently the malicious pursuer. Naturally, it
is not the actual mother, although the actual mother, with
the abnormal tenderness with which she sometimes pursues
her child, even into adult years, may gravely injure
it through a willful prolonging of the infantile state in
the child. It is rather the mother-imago, which becomes
the Lamia. The mother-imago, however, possesses its
power solely and exclusively from the son’s tendency not
only to look and to work forwards, but also to glance
backwards to the pampering sweetness of childhood, to
that glorious state of irresponsibility and security with
which the protecting mother-care once surrounded him.<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c008'><sup>[617]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The retrospective longing acts like a paralyzing poison
upon the energy and enterprise; so that it may well be
compared to a poisonous serpent which lies across our
path. Apparently, it is a hostile demon which robs us
of energy, but, in reality, it is the individual unconscious,
the retrogressive tendency of which begins to overcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the conscious forward striving. The cause of this can
be, for example, the natural aging which weakens the
energy, or it may be great external difficulties, which
cause man to break down and become a child again, or
it may be, and this is probably the most frequent cause,
the woman who enslaves the man, so that he can no
longer free himself, and becomes a child again.<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c008'><sup>[618]</sup></a> It may
be of significance also that Isis, as sister-wife of the sun-god,
creates the poisonous animal from the spittle of the
god, which is perhaps a substitute for sperma, and, therefore,
is a symbol of libido. She creates the animal from
the libido of the god; that means she receives his power,
making him weak and dependent, so that by this means
she assumes the dominating rôle of the mother. (Mother
transference to the wife.) This part is preserved in the
legend of Samson, in the rôle of Delilah, who cut off
Samson’s hair, the sun’s rays, thus robbing him of his
strength.<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c008'><sup>[619]</sup></a> Any weakening of the adult man strengthens
the wishes of the unconscious; therefore, the decrease of
strength appears directly as the backward striving towards
the mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is still to be considered one more source of the
reanimation of the mother-imago. We have already met
it in the discussion of the mother scene in “Faust,” that
is to say, <em>the willed introversion of a creative mind</em>, which,
retreating before its own problem and inwardly collecting
its forces, dips at least for a moment into the source of
life, in order there to wrest a little more strength from
the mother for the completion of its work. It is a mother-child
play with one’s self, in which lies much weak selfadmiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>and self-adulation (“Among a hundred mirrors”—Nietzsche);
<em>a Narcissus state</em>, a strange spectacle,
perhaps, for profane eyes. The separation from
the mother-imago, the birth out of one’s self, reconciles all
conflicts through the sufferings. This is probably meant
by Nietzsche’s verse:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why hast thou enticed thyself</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the Paradise of the old serpent?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why hast thou crept</div>
      <div class='line'>Into thyself, thyself?...</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A sick man now</div>
      <div class='line'>Sick of a serpent’s poison,<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c008'><sup>[620]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>A captive now</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom the hardest destiny befell</div>
      <div class='line'>In thine own pit;</div>
      <div class='line'>Bowed down as thou workest</div>
      <div class='line'>Encaved within thyself,</div>
      <div class='line'>Burrowing into thyself,</div>
      <div class='line'>Helpless,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stiff,</div>
      <div class='line'>A corpse.</div>
      <div class='line'>Overwhelmed with a hundred burdens,</div>
      <div class='line'>Overburdened by thyself.</div>
      <div class='line'>A wise man,</div>
      <div class='line'>A self-knower,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wise Zarathustra;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou soughtest the heaviest burden</div>
      <div class='line'>And foundest thou thyself....”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The symbolism of this speech is of the greatest richness.
He is buried in the depths of <em>self, as if in the earth</em>;
really a dead man who has turned back to mother
earth;<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c008'><sup>[621]</sup></a> a Kaineus “piled with a hundred burdens” and
pressed down to death; the one who groaning bears the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>heavy burden of his own libido, of that libido which
draws him back to the mother. Who does not think of
the Taurophoria of Mithra, who took his bull (according
to the Egyptian hymn, “the bull of his mother”),
that is, his love for his mother, the heaviest burden upon
his back, and with that entered upon the painful course
of the so-called Transitus!<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c008'><sup>[622]</sup></a> This path of passion led to
the cave, in which the bull was sacrificed. Christ, too, had
to bear the cross,<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c008'><sup>[623]</sup></a> the symbol of his love for the mother,
and he carried it to the place of sacrifice where the lamb
was slain in the form of the God, the infantile man, a
“self-executioner,” and then to burial in the subterranean
sepulchre.<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c008'><sup>[624]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>That which in Nietzsche appears as a poetical figure of
speech is really a primitive myth. It is as if the poet
still possessed a dim idea or capacity to feel and reactivate
those imperishable phantoms of long-past worlds of
thought in the words of our present-day speech and in
the images which crowd themselves into his phantasy.
Hauptmann also says: “Poetic rendering is that which
allows the echo of the primitive word to resound through
the form.”<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c008'><sup>[625]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The sacrifice, with its mysterious and manifold meaning,
which is rather hinted at than expressed, passes unrecognized
in the unconscious of our author. The arrow
is not shot, the hero Chiwantopel is not yet fatally
poisoned and ready for death through self-sacrifice. We
now can say, according to the preceding material, this
sacrifice means renouncing the mother, that is to say, <em>renunciation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>of all bonds and limitations which the soul
has taken with it from the period of childhood into the
adult life</em>. From various hints of Miss Miller’s it appears
that at the time of these phantasies she was still
living in the circle of the family, evidently at an age
which was in urgent need of independence. That is to
say, man does not live very long in the infantile environment
or in the bosom of his family without real danger
to his mental health. Life calls him forth to independence,
and he who gives no heed to this hard call because
of childish indolence and fear is threatened by a neurosis,
and once the neurosis has broken out it becomes more and
more a valid reason to escape the battle with life and to
remain for all time in the morally poisoned infantile
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c007'>The phantasy of the arrow-wound belongs in this
struggle for personal independence. The thought of this
resolution has not yet penetrated the dreamer. On the
contrary, she rather repudiates it. After all the preceding,
it is evident that the symbolism of the arrow-wound
through direct translation must be taken as a coitus
symbol. The “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Occide moriturus</span>” attains by this means
the sexual significance belonging to it. Chiwantopel naturally
represents the dreamer. But nothing is attained and
nothing is understood through one’s reduction to the
coarse sexual, because it is a commonplace that the unconscious
shelters coitus wishes, the discovery of which
signifies nothing further. <em>The coitus wish under this
aspect is really a symbol for the individual demonstration
of the libido separated from the parents, of the conquest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of an independent life.</em> This step towards a new life
means, at the same time, the death of the past life.<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c008'><sup>[626]</sup></a>
Therefore, Chiwantopel is the infantile hero<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c008'><sup>[627]</sup></a> (the son,
the child, the lamb, the fish) who is still enchained by
the fetters of childhood and who has to die as a symbol
of the incestuous libido, and with that sever the retrogressive
bond. For the entire libido is demanded for
the battle of life, and there can be no remaining behind.
The dreamer cannot yet come to this decision, which will
tear aside all the sentimental connections with father
and mother, and yet it must be made in order to follow
the call of the individual destiny.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>
  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>THE DUAL MOTHER RÔLE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After the disappearance of the assailant, Chiwantopel
begins the following monologue:</p>

<p class='c017'>“From the extreme ends of these continents, from the farthest
lowlands, after having forsaken the palace of my father, I have
been wandering aimlessly during a hundred moons, always pursued
by my mad desire to find ‘her who will understand.’ With
jewels I have tempted many fair ones, with kisses I have tried
to snatch the secret of their hearts, with acts of bravery I have
conquered their admiration. (He reviews the women he has
known.) Chita, the princess of my race&nbsp;... she is a little fool,
vain as a peacock, having nought in her head but jewels and
perfume. Ta-nan, the young peasant,&nbsp;... bah, a mere sow, no
more than a breast and a stomach, caring only for pleasure. And
then Ki-ma, the priestess, a true parrot, repeating hollow phrases
learnt from the priests; all for show, without real education or
sincerity, suspicious poseur and hypocrite!... Alas! Not one
who understands me, not one who resembles me, not one who
has a soul sister to mine. There is not one among them all who
has known my soul, not one who could read my thought; far
from it; not one capable of seeking with me the luminous summits,
or of spelling with me the superhuman word, love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here Chiwantopel himself says that his journeying and
wandering is a quest for that other, and for the meaning
of life which lies in union with her. In the first part of
this work we merely hinted gently at this possibility. The
fact that the seeker is masculine and the sought-for of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>feminine sex is not so astonishing, because the chief object
of the unconscious transference is the mother, as has
probably been seen from that which we have already
learned. The daughter takes a male attitude towards the
mother. The genesis of this adjustment can only be suspected
in our case, because objective proof is lacking.
Therefore, let us rather be satisfied with inferences.
“She who will understand” means the mother, in the infantile
language. At the same time, it also means the life
companion. As is well known, the sex contrast concerns
the libido but little. The sex of the object plays a surprisingly
slight rôle in the estimation of the unconscious.
The object itself, taken as an objective reality, is but of
slight significance. (But it is of greatest importance
whether the libido is transferred or introverted.) The
original concrete meaning of <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">erfassen</span></i>, “to seize,”
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">begreifen</span></i>, “to touch,” etc., allows us to recognize clearly
the under side of the wish—to find a congenial person.
But the “upper” intellectual half is also contained in it,
and is to be taken into account at the same time. One
might be inclined to assume this tendency if it were not
that our culture abused the same, for the misunderstood
woman has become almost proverbial, which can only be
the result of a wholly distorted valuation. On the one
side, our culture undervalues most extraordinarily the importance
of sexuality; on the other side, sexuality breaks
out as a direct result of the repression burdening it at
every place where it does not belong, and makes use of
such an indirect manner of expression that one may expect
to meet it suddenly almost anywhere. Thus the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>idea of the intimate comprehension of a human soul,
which is in reality something very beautiful and pure, is
soiled and disagreeably distorted through the entrance
of the indirect sexual meaning.<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c008'><sup>[628]</sup></a> The secondary meaning
or, better expressed, the misuse, which repressed and
denied sexuality forces upon the highest soul functions,
makes it possible, for example, for certain of our opponents
to scent in psychoanalysis prurient erotic confessionals.
These are subjective wish-fulfilment deliria
which need no contra arguments. This misuse makes the
wish to be “understood” highly suspicious, if the natural
demands of life have not been fulfilled. Nature has <em>first
claim</em> on man; only long afterwards does the luxury of
intellect come. The mediæval ideal of life for the sake
of death needs gradually to be replaced by a natural conception
of life, in which the normal demands of men are
thoroughly kept in mind, so that the desires of the animal
sphere may no longer be compelled to drag down into
their service the high gifts of the intellectual sphere in
order to find an outlet. We are inclined, therefore, to
consider the dreamer’s wish for understanding, first of
all, as a repressed striving towards the natural destiny.
This meaning coincides absolutely with psychoanalytic
experience, that there are countless neurotic people who
apparently are prevented from experiencing life because
they have an unconscious and often also a conscious repugnance
to the sexual fate, under which they imagine
all kinds of ugly things. There is only too great an inclination
to yield to this pressure of the unconscious sexuality
and to experience the dreaded (unconsciously hoped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>for) disagreeable sexual experience, so as to acquire by
that means a legitimately founded horror which retains
them more surely in the infantile situation. This is the
reason why so many people fall into that very state
towards which they have the greatest abhorrence.</p>

<p class='c007'>That we were correct in our assumption that, in Miss
Miller, it is a question of the battle for independence
is shown by her statement that the hero’s departure from
his father’s house reminds her of the fate of the young
Buddha, who likewise renounced all luxury to which he
was born in order to go out into the world to live out
his destiny to its completion. Buddha gave the same
heroic example as did Christ, who separated from his
mother, and even spoke bitter words (Matthew, chap.
x. v. 34):</p>

<p class='c017'>“Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came
not to send peace, but a sword.</p>

<p class='c017'>(35) “For I am come to set a man at variance against his
father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law
against her mother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c017'>(36) “And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.</p>

<p class='c017'>(37) “He that loveth father or mother more than me is not
worthy of me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Or <cite>Luke</cite>, chap. xii, v. 51:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you,
Nay: but rather division.</p>

<p class='c017'>(52) “For from henceforth there shall be five in one house
divided, three against two, and two against three.</p>

<p class='c017'>(53) “The father shall be divided against the son, and the son
against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the
daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Horus snatched from his mother her head adornment,
the power. Just as Adam struggled with Lilith, so he
struggles for power. Nietzsche, in “Human, All Too
Human,” expressed the same in very beautiful words:</p>

<p class='c017'>“One may suppose that a mind, in which the ‘type of free
mind’ is to ripen and sweeten at maturity, has had its decisive
crisis in a great detachment, so that before this time it was just
so much the more a fettered spirit and appeared chained forever
to its corner and its pillar.<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c008'><sup>[629]</sup></a> What binds it most firmly?
What cords are almost untearable? Among human beings of a
high and exquisite type, it would be duties: that reverence, which
is suitable for youth, that modesty and tenderness for all the old
honored and valued things, that thankfulness for the earth from
which they grew, for the hand which guided them, for the shrine
where they learnt to pray:—their loftiest moments themselves
come to bind them the firmest, to obligate them the most permanently.
The great detachment comes suddenly for people so
bound.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Better to die than to live here,’—thus rings the imperative
voice of seduction: and this here, this ‘at home’ is all, that it (the
soul) has loved until now! A sudden terror and suspicion against
that which it has loved, a lightning flash of scorn towards that
which is called ‘duty,’ a rebellious, arbitrary, volcanic, impelling
desire for travelling, for strange countries, estrangements, coolness,
frigidity, disillusionments, a hatred of love, perhaps a sacrilegious
touch and glance backwards<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c008'><sup>[630]</sup></a> there where just now it
adored and loved, perhaps a blush of shame over what it has just
done, and at the same time an exultation over having done it, an
intoxicating internal joyous thrill, in which a victory reveals itself—a
victory? Over what? Over whom? An enigmatic, doubtful,
questioning victory, but the first triumph. Of such woe and
pain is formed the history of the great detachment. It is like a
disease which can destroy men,—this first eruption of strength
and will towards self-assertion.”<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c008'><sup>[631]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>The danger lies, as is brilliantly expressed by Nietzsche,
in isolation in one’s self:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Solitude surrounds and embraces him ever more threatening,
ever more constricting, ever more heart-strangling, the terrible
Goddess and Mater sæva cupidinum.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The libido taken away from the mother, who is abandoned
only reluctantly, becomes threatening as a serpent,
the symbol of death, for the relation to the mother must
cease, <em>must die, which itself almost causes man’s death</em>.
In “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mater sæva cupidinum</span>” the idea attains rare, almost
conscious, perfection.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not presume to try to paint in better words than
has Nietzsche the psychology of the wrench from childhood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Miller furnishes us with a further reference to
a material which has influenced her creation in a more
general manner; this is the great Indian epic of Longfellow,
“The Song of Hiawatha.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If my readers have had patience to read thus far, and
to reflect upon what they have read, they frequently must
have wondered at the number of times I introduce for
comparison such apparently foreign material and how
often I widen the base upon which Miss Miller’s creations
rest. Doubts must often have arisen whether it is
justifiable to enter into important discussions concerning
the psychologic foundations of myths, religions and culture
in general on the basis of such scanty suggestions.
It might be said that behind the Miller phantasies such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>thing is scarcely to be found. I need hardly emphasize
the fact that I, too, have sometimes been in doubt. I
had never read “Hiawatha” until, in the course of my
work, I came to this part. “Hiawatha,” a poetical compilation
of Indian myths, gives me, however, a justification
for all preceding reflections, because this epic contains
an unusual number of mythologic problems. This
fact is probably of great importance for the wealth of
suggestions in the Miller phantasies. We are, therefore,
compelled to obtain an insight into this epic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nawadaha sings the songs of the epic of the hero
Hiawatha, the friend of man:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There he sang of Hiawatha,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sang the songs of Hiawatha,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sang his wondrous birth and being,</div>
      <div class='line'>How he prayed and how he fasted,</div>
      <div class='line'>How he lived and toiled and suffered,</div>
      <div class='line'>That the tribes of men might prosper,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he might advance his people.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The teleological meaning of the hero, as that symbolic
figure which unites in itself libido in the form of admiration
and adoration, in order to lead to higher sublimations
by way of the symbolic bridges of the myths, is
anticipated here. Thus we become quickly acquainted
with Hiawatha as a savior, and are prepared to hear all
that which must be said of a savior, of his marvellous
birth, of his early great deeds, and his sacrifice for his
fellow-men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first song begins with a fragment of evangelism:
Gitche Manito, the “master of life,” tired of the quarrels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>of his human children, calls his people together and makes
known to them the joyous message:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I will send a prophet to you,</div>
      <div class='line'>A Deliverer of the nations,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who shall guide you and shall teach you,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who shall toil and suffer with you.</div>
      <div class='line'>If you listen to his counsels,</div>
      <div class='line'>You will multiply and prosper.</div>
      <div class='line'>If his warnings pass unheeded,</div>
      <div class='line'>You will fade away and perish!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Gitche Manito, the Mighty, “the creator of the nations,”
is represented as he stood erect “on the great Red
Pipestone quarry.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“From his footprints flowed a river,</div>
      <div class='line'>Leaped into the light of morning,</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er the precipice plunging downward</div>
      <div class='line'>Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The water flowing from his footsteps sufficiently
proves the phallic nature of this creator. I refer to the
earlier utterances concerning the phallic and fertilizing
nature of the horse’s foot and the horse’s steps, and especially
do I recall Hippocrene and the foot of Pegasus.<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c008'><sup>[632]</sup></a>
We meet with the same idea in Psalm lxv, vv. 9 to 11:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it; thou makest it very
plenteous.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The river of God is full of water; thou preparest their corn,
for so thou providest for the earth.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thou waterest her furrows: thou sendest rain into the little
valleys thereof; thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and
blessest the increase of it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths
drop fatness.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Wherever the fertilizing God steps, there is fruitfulness.
We already have spoken of the symbolic meaning
of treading in discussing the nightmares. Kaineus passes
into the depths, “splitting the earth with a foot outstretched.”
Amphiaraus, another chthonic hero, sinks
into the earth, which Zeus has opened for him by a stroke
of lightning. (Compare with that the above-mentioned
vision of a hysterical patient, who saw a black horse after
a flash of lightning: identity of horse’s footstep and flash
of lightning.) By means of a flash of lightning heroes
were made immortal.<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c008'><sup>[633]</sup></a> Faust attained the mothers when
he stamped his foot.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Stamp and descend, stamping thou’lt rise again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes in the sun-devouring myths often stamp at
or struggle in the jaws of the monster. Thus Tor
stamped through the ship’s bottom in battle with the
monster, and <em>went as far as the bottom of the sea</em>.
(Kaineus.) (Concerning “kicking” as an infantile
phantasy, see above.) The regression of the libido to
the presexual stage makes this preparatory action of
treading either a substitution for the coitus phantasy or
for the phantasy of re-entrance into the mother’s womb.
The comparison of water flowing from the footsteps with
a comet is a light symbolism for the fructifying moisture
(sperma). According to an observation by Humboldt
(Kosmos), certain South American Indian tribes call the
meteors “urine of the stars.” Mention is also made of
how Gitche Manito makes fire. He blows upon a forest,
so that the trees, rubbing upon each other, burst into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>flame. This demon is, therefore, an excellent libido symbol;
he also produced fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this prologue in the second song, the hero’s previous
history is related. The great warrior, Mudjekeewis
(Hiawatha’s father), has cunningly overcome the great
bear, “the terror of the nations,” and stolen from him
the magic “belt of wampum,” a girdle of shells. Here
we meet the motive of the “treasure attained with difficulty,”
which the hero rescues from the monster. Who
the bear is, is shown by the poet’s comparisons. Mudjekeewis
strikes the bear on his head after he has robbed
him of the treasure.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With the heavy blow bewildered</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose the great Bear of the mountains,</div>
      <div class='line'>But his knees beneath him trembled,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he whimpered <em>like a woman</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mudjekeewis said derisively to him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Else you would not cry, and whimper,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a <em>miserable woman</em>!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But you, Bear! sit here and whimper,</div>
      <div class='line'>And disgrace your tribe by crying,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a wretched Shaugodaya,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a <em>cowardly old woman</em>!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These three comparisons with a woman are to be
found near each other on the same page. Mudjekeewis
has, like a true hero, once more torn life from the jaws
of death, from the all-devouring “terrible mother.”
This deed, which, as we have seen, is also represented as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>a journey to hell, “night journey through the sea,” the
conquering of the monster from within, signifies at the
same time entrance into the mother’s womb, a rebirth,
the results of which are perceptible also for Mudjekeewis.
As in the Zosimos vision, here too the entering one becomes
the breath of the wind or spirit. Mudjekeewis
becomes the west wind, the fertilizing breath, the father
of winds.<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c008'><sup>[634]</sup></a> His sons become the other winds. An intermezzo
tells of them and of their love stories, of which I
will mention only the courtship of Wabuns, the East
Wind, because here the erotic wooing of the wind is pictured
in an especially beautiful manner. Every morning
he sees a beautiful girl in a meadow, whom he eagerly
courts:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Every morning, gazing earthward,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still the first thing he beheld there</div>
      <div class='line'>Was her blue eyes looking at him,</div>
      <div class='line'>Two blue lakes among the rushes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The comparison with water is not a matter of secondary
importance, because “from wind and water”
shall man be born anew.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And he wooed her with caresses,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wooed her with his smile of sunshine,</div>
      <div class='line'>With his flattering words he wooed her,</div>
      <div class='line'>With his sighing and his singing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gentlest whispers in the branches,</div>
      <div class='line'>Softest music, sweetest odors,” etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In these onomatopoetic verses the wind’s caressing
courtship is excellently expressed.<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c008'><sup>[635]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>The third song presents the previous history of
Hiawatha’s mother. His grandmother, when a maiden,
lived in the moon. There she once swung upon a liana,
but a jealous lover cut off the liana, and Nokomis,
Hiawatha’s grandmother, fell to earth. The people, who
saw her fall downwards, thought that she was a <em>shooting
star</em>. This marvellous descent of Nokomis is more
plainly illustrated by a later passage of this same song;
there little Hiawatha asks the grandmother what is the
moon. Nokomis teaches him about it as follows: The
moon is the body of a <em>grandmother</em>, whom a warlike
grandson has cast up there in wrath. Hence the moon is
the <em>grandmother</em>. In ancient beliefs, the moon is also
the gathering place of departed souls,<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c008'><sup>[636]</sup></a> the guardian of
seeds; therefore, once more a place of the origin of life
of predominantly feminine significance. The remarkable
thing is that Nokomis, falling upon the earth, gave birth
to a daughter, Wenonah, subsequently the mother of
Hiawatha. The throwing upwards of the mother, and
her falling down and bringing forth, seems to contain
something typical in itself. Thus a story of the seventeenth
century relates that a mad bull threw a pregnant
woman as high as a house, and tore open her womb, and
the child fell without harm upon the earth. On account
of his wonderful birth, this child was considered a hero
or doer of miracles, but he died at an early age. The
belief is widespread among lower savages that the sun is
feminine and the moon masculine. Among the Namaqua,
a Hottentot tribe, the opinion is prevalent that the sun
consists of transparent bacon.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>“The people, who journey on boats, draw it down by magic
every evening, cut off a suitable piece and then give it <em>a kick so
that it flies up again into the sky</em>.”—<em>Waitz</em>: “Anthropologie,”
II, 342.</p>

<p class='c007'>The infantile nourishment comes from the mother. In
the Gnostic phantasies we come across a legend of the
origin of man which possibly belongs here: the female
archons bound to the vault of Heaven are unable, on
account of its quick rotation, to keep their young within
them, but let them fall upon the earth, from which men
arise. Possibly there is here a connection with barbaric
midwifery, the letting fall of the parturient. The assault
upon the mother is already introduced with the adventure
of Mudjekeewis, and is continued in the violent handling
of the “grandmother,” Nokomis, who, as a result of the
cutting of the liana and the fall downwards, seems in
some way to have become pregnant. The “cutting of
the branch,” the plucking, we have already recognized as
mother incest. (See above.) That well-known verse,
“Saxonland, where beautiful maidens grow upon trees,”
and phrases like “picking cherries in a neighbor’s garden,”
allude to a similar idea. The fall downwards of
Nokomis deserves to be compared to a poetical figure in
Heine.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A star, a star is falling</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Out of the glittering sky!</div>
      <div class='line'>The star of Love! I watch it</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sink in the depths and die.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The leaves and buds are falling</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Embrace them wantonly...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Wenonah later was courted by the caressing West
Wind, and becomes pregnant. Wenonah, as a young
moon-goddess, has the beauty of the moonlight. Nokomis
warns her of the dangerous courtship of Mudjekeewis, the
West Wind. But Wenonah allows herself to become infatuated,
and conceives from the breath of the wind,
from the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πνεῦμα</span>, a son, our hero.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And the West-Wind came at evening,</div>
    </div>

      <div class='line'>Bore a son of love and sorrow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Fertilization through the breath of the spirit is already
a well-known precedent for us. The star or comet
plainly belongs to the birth scene as a libido symbol; Nokomis,
too, comes to earth as a shooting star. Mörike’s
sweet poetic phantasy has devised a similar divine origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buddha’s marvellous birth story, retold by Sir Edwin

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After the birth the four genii of the East, West, South
and North come to render service as bearers of the
palanquin. (The coming of the wise men at Christ’s
birth.) We also find here a distinct reference to the
“four winds.” For the completion of the symbolism
there is to be found in the Buddha myth, as well as in
the birth legend of Christ, besides the impregnation by
star and wind, also the fertilization by an animal, here
an elephant, which with its phallic trunk fulfilled in Maya
the Christian method of fructification through the ear or
the head. It is well known that, in addition to the dove,
the unicorn is also a procreative symbol of the Logos.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here arises the question why the birth of a hero always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>had to take place under such strange symbolic circumstances?
It might also be imagined that a hero arose
from ordinary surroundings and gradually grew out of
his inferior environment, perhaps with a thousand troubles
and dangers. (And, indeed, this motive is by no
means strange in the hero myth.) It might be said that
superstition demands strange conditions of birth and generation;
but why does it demand them?</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer to this question is: that the birth of the
hero, as a rule, is not that of an ordinary mortal, but is
a rebirth from the mother-spouse; hence it occurs under
mysterious ceremonies. Therefore, in the very beginning,
lies the motive of the two mothers of the hero. As
Rank<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c008'><sup>[639]</sup></a> has shown us through many examples, the hero
is often obliged to experience exposure, and upbringing
by foster parents, and in this manner he acquires the two
mothers. A striking example is the relation of Hercules
to Hera. In the Hiawatha epic Wenonah dies after the
birth and Nokomis takes her place. Maya dies after the
birth<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c008'><sup>[640]</sup></a> and Buddha is given a stepmother. The stepmother
is sometimes an animal (the she-wolf of Romulus
and Remus, etc.). The twofold mother may be replaced
by the motive of twofold birth, which has attained a
lofty significance in the Christian mythology; namely,
through baptism, which, as we have seen, represents rebirth.
Thus man is born not merely in a commonplace
manner, but also born again in a mysterious manner, by
means of which he becomes a participator of the kingdom
of God, of immortality. Any one may become a hero
in this way who is generated anew through his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>mother, because only through her does he share in immortality.
Therefore, it happened that the death of
Christ on the cross, which creates universal salvation, was
understood as “baptism”; that is to say, as rebirth
through the second mother, the mysterious tree of death.
Christ says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“But I have a baptism to be baptized with: and how am I
straitened till it be accomplished!”—<cite>Luke</cite> xii: 50.</p>

<p class='c007'>He interprets his death agony symbolically as birth
agony.</p>

<p class='c007'>The motive of the two mothers suggests the thought
of self-rejuvenation, and evidently expresses the fulfilment
of the wish that it <em>might be possible for the mother
to bear me again</em>; at the same time, applied to the heroes,
it means one is a hero who is borne again by her who has
previously been his mother; that is to say, <em>a hero is he
who may again produce himself through his mother</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The countless suggestions in the history of the procreation
of the heroes indicate the latter formulations. Hiawatha’s
father first overpowered the mother under the
symbol of the bear; then himself becoming a god, he procreates
the hero. What Hiawatha had to do as hero,
Nokomis hinted to him in the legend of the origin of the
moon; he is forcibly to throw his mother upwards (or
throw downwards?); then she would become pregnant
by this act of violence and could bring forth a daughter.
This rejuvenated mother would be allotted, according to
the Egyptian rite, as a daughter-wife to the sun-god, the
father of his mother, for self-reproduction. What action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>Hiawatha takes in this regard we shall see presently.
We have already studied the behavior of the pre-Asiatic
gods related to Christ. Concerning the pre-existence of
Christ, the Gospel of St. John is full of this thought.
Thus the speech of John the Baptist:</p>

<p class='c017'>“This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
preferred before me; for he was before me.”—<cite>John</cite> i: 30.</p>

<p class='c007'>Also the beginning of the gospel is full of deep mythologic
significance:</p>

<p class='c017'>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning
with God.</p>

<p class='c017'>(3) “All things were made by him, and without him was not
anything made that was made.</p>

<p class='c017'>(4) “In him was life, and the <em>life</em> was the <em>light of men</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>(5) “And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth
it not.</p>

<p class='c017'>(6) “There was a man sent from God whose name was John.</p>

<p class='c017'>(7) “The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the
Light.</p>

<p class='c017'>(8) “He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of
that Light.</p>

<p class='c017'>(9) “That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the proclamation of the reappearing light, the
reborn sun, which formerly was, and which will be again.
In the baptistry at Pisa, Christ is represented bringing
the tree of life to man; his head is surrounded by a sun
halo. Over this relief stand the words <span class='sc'>Introitus Solis</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Because the one born was his own procreator, the history
of his procreation is strangely concealed under symbolic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>events, which are meant to conceal and deny it;
hence the extraordinary assertion of the virgin conception.
This is meant to hide the incestuous impregnation.
But do not let us forget that this naïve assertion plays an
unusually important part in the ingenious symbolic bridge,
which is to guide the libido out from the incestuous bond
to higher and more useful applications, which indicate a
new kind of immortality; that is to say, immortal work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The environment of Hiawatha’s youth is of importance:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“By the shores of Gitche Gumee,</div>
      <div class='line'>By the shining Big-Sea-Water,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,</div>
      <div class='line'>Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dark behind it rose the forest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose the firs with cones upon them.</div>
      <div class='line'>Bright before it beat the water,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beat the clear and sunny water,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In this environment Nokomis brought him up. Here
she taught him the first words, and told him the first fairy
tales, and the sounds of the water and the wood were
intermingled, so that the child learned not only to understand
man’s speech, but also that of Nature:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“At the door on summer evenings</div>
      <div class='line'>Sat the little Hiawatha;</div>
      <div class='line'>Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heard the lapping of the water,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sounds of music, words of wonder:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Minne-wawa!’<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c008'><sup>[641]</sup></a> said the pine-trees,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Mudway-aushka!’<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c008'><sup>[642]</sup></a> said the water.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Hiawatha hears human speech in the sounds of Nature;
thus he understands Nature’s speech. The wind
says, “Wawa.” The cry of the wild goose is “Wawa.”
Wah-wah-taysee means the small glowworm which enchants
him. Thus the poet paints most beautifully the
gradual gathering of external nature into the compass of
the subjective,<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c008'><sup>[643]</sup></a> and the intimate connection of the primary
object to which the first lisping words were applied,
and from which the first sounds were derived, with the
secondary object, the wider nature which usurps imperceptibly
the mother’s place, and takes possession of those
sounds heard first from the mother, and also of those
feelings which we all discover later in ourselves in all
the warm love of Mother Nature. The later blending,
whether pantheistic-philosophic or æsthetic, of the sentimental,
cultured man with nature is, looked at retrospectively,
a reblending with the mother, who was our primary
object, and with whom we truly were once wholly one.<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c008'><sup>[644]</sup></a>
Therefore, it is not astonishing when we again see
emerging in the poetical speech of a modern philosopher,
Karl Joël, the old pictures which symbolize the unity with
the mother, illustrated by the confluence of subject and
object. In his recent book, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Seele und Welt</span>” (1912),
Joël writes as follows, in the chapter called “Primal Experience”<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c008'><sup>[645]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I lay on the seashore, the shining waters glittering in my
dreamy eyes; at a great distance fluttered the soft breeze; throbbing,
shimmering, stirring, lulling to sleep comes the wave beat to
the shore—or to the ear? I know not. Distance and nearness
become blurred into one; without and within glide into each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>other. Nearer and nearer, <em>dearer and more homelike sounds the
beating of the waves</em>; now, like a thundering pulse in my head it
strikes, and now it beats over my soul, devours it, embraces it,
while it itself at the same time floats out like the blue waste of
waters. Yes, without and within are one. Glistening and foaming,
flowing and fanning and roaring, the entire symphony of the
stimuli experienced sounds in one tone, all thought becomes one
thought, which becomes one with feeling; the world exhales in
the soul and the soul dissolves in the world. Our small life is
encircled by a great sleep—<em>the sleep of our cradle, the sleep of our
grave, the sleep of our home, from which we go forth in the morning,
to which we again return in the evening</em>; our life but the
short journey, the interval between the emergence from the original
oneness and the sinking back into it! Blue shimmers the
infinite sea, wherein dreams the jelly fish of the primitive life,
toward which without ceasing our thoughts hark back dimly
through eons of existence. For every happening entails a change
and a guarantee of the unity of life. At that moment when they
are no longer blended together, in that instant man lifts his <em>head,
blind and dripping, from the depths</em> of the stream of experience,
from the oneness with the experience; at that moment of parting
when the unity of life in startled surprise detaches the Change
and holds it away from itself as something alien, at this moment
of alienation the aspects of the experience have been substantialized
into subject and object, and in that moment consciousness is
born.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joël paints here, in unmistakable symbolism, the confluence
of subject and object as the reunion of mother
and child. The symbols agree with those of mythology,
even in their details. The encircling and devouring motive
is distinctly suggested. The sea, devouring the sun
and giving birth to it anew, is already an old acquaintance.
The moment of the rise of consciousness, the separation
of subject and object is a birth; truly philosophical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>thought hangs with lame wings upon the few great primitive
pictures of human speech, above the simple, all-surpassing
greatness of which no thought can rise. The idea
of the jelly fish is not “accidental.” Once when I was
explaining to a patient the maternal significance of water
at this contact with the mother complex, she experienced
a very unpleasant feeling. “It makes me squirm,” she
said, “as if I touched a jelly fish.” Here, too, the same
idea! The blessed state of sleep before birth and after
death is, as Joël observed, something like old shadowy
memories of that unsuspecting, thoughtless state of early
childhood, where as yet no opposition disturbed the peaceful
flow of dawning life, to which the inner longing
always draws us back again and again, and from which
the active life must free itself anew with struggle and
death, so that it may not be doomed to destruction. Long
before Joël, an Indian chieftain had said the same thing
in similar words to one of the restless wise men:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Ah, my brother, you will never learn to know the happiness
of thinking nothing and doing nothing: this is next to sleep; this
is the most delightful thing there is. Thus we were before birth,
thus we shall be after death.”<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c008'><sup>[646]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>We shall see in Hiawatha’s later fate how important
his early impressions are in his choice of a wife. Hiawatha’s
first deed was to kill a roebuck with his arrow:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dead he lay there in the forest,</div>
      <div class='line'>By the ford across the river.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This is typical of Hiawatha’s deeds. Whatever he
kills, for the most part, lies <em>next to or in the water</em>, sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>half in the water and half on the land.<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c008'><sup>[647]</sup></a> It seems
that this must well be so. The later adventures will
teach us why this must be so. The buck was no ordinary
animal, but a magic one; that is to say, one with an additional
unconscious significance. Hiawatha made for himself
gloves and moccasins from its hide; the gloves imparted
such strength to his arms that he could crumble
rocks to dust, and the moccasins had the virtue of the
seven-league boots. By enwrapping himself in the buck’s
skin he really became a giant. This motive, together with
the death of the animal at the ford,<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c008'><sup>[648]</sup></a> in the water, reveals
the fact that the parents are concerned, whose
gigantic proportions as compared with the child are of
great significance in the unconscious. The “toys of
giants” is a wish inversion of the infantile phantasy.
The dream of an eleven-year-old girl expresses this:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am as high as a church steeple; then a policeman comes. I
tell him, ‘If you say anything, I will cut off your head.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The “policeman,” as the analysis brought out, referred
to the father, whose gigantic size was over-compensated
by the church steeple. In Mexican human sacrifices,
the gods were represented by criminals, who were
slaughtered, and flayed, and the Corybantes then clothed
themselves in the bloody skins, in order to illustrate the
resurrection of the gods.<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c008'><sup>[649]</sup></a> (The snake’s casting of his
skin as a symbol of rejuvenation.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Hiawatha has, therefore, conquered his parents, primarily
the mother, although in the form of a male animal
(compare the bear of Mudjekeewis); and from that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>comes his giant’s strength. He has taken on the parent’s
skin and now has himself become a great man. Now he
started forth to his first great battle to fight with the
father Mudjekeewis, in order to avenge his dead mother
Wenonah. Naturally, under this figure of speech hides
the thought that he slays the father, in order to take possession
of the mother. Compare the battle of Gilgamesh
with the giant Chumbaba and the ensuing conquest of
Ishtar. The father, in the psychologic sense, merely represents
the personification of the incest prohibition; that
is to say, resistance, which defends the mother. Instead
of the father, it may be a fearful animal (the great bear,
the snake, the dragon, etc.) which must be fought and
overcome. The hero is a hero because he sees in every
difficulty of life resistance to the forbidden treasure, and
fights that resistance with the complete yearning which
strives towards the treasure, attainable with difficulty, or
unattainable, the yearning which paralyzes and kills the
ordinary man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hiawatha’s father is Mudjekeewis, the west wind; the
battle, therefore, takes place in the west. Thence came
life (impregnation of Wenonah); thence also came
death (death of Wenonah). Hiawatha, therefore,
fights the typical battle of the hero for rebirth in the
western sea, the battle with the devouring terrible
mother, this time in the form of the father. Mudjekeewis,
who himself had acquired a divine nature, through
his conquest of the bear, now is overpowered by his son:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Back retreated Mudjekeewis,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rushing westward o’er the mountains,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Stumbling westward down the mountains,</div>
      <div class='line'>Three whole days retreated fighting,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still pursued by Hiawatha</div>
      <div class='line'>To the doorways of the West-Wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the portals of the Sunset,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the earth’s remotest border,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where into the empty spaces</div>
      <div class='line'>Sinks the sun, as a flamingo</div>
      <div class='line'>Drops into her nest at nightfall.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The “three days” are a stereotyped form representing
the stay in the sea prison of night. (Twenty-first
until twenty-fourth of December.) Christ, too, remained
three days in the underworld. “The treasure, difficult
to attain,” is captured by the hero during this struggle
in the west. In this case the father must make a great
concession to the son; he gives him divine nature,<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c008'><sup>[650]</sup></a> that
very wind nature, the immortality of which alone protected
Mudjekeewis from death. He says to his son:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I will share my kingdom with you,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ruler shall you be henceforward,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the home-wind, the Keewaydin.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That Hiawatha now becomes ruler of the home-wind
has its close parallel in the Gilgamesh epic, where Gilgamesh
finally receives the magic herb from the wise old
Utnapishtim, who dwells in the West, which brings him
safe once more over the sea to his home; but this, when
he is home again, is retaken from him by a serpent.</p>

<p class='c007'>When one has slain the father, one can obtain possession
of his wife, and when one has conquered the mother,
one can free one’s self.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>On the return journey Hiawatha stops at the clever
arrow-maker’s, who possesses a lovely daughter:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And he named her from the river,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the water-fall he named her,</div>
      <div class='line'>Minnehaha, Laughing Water.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When Hiawatha, in his earliest childhood dreaming,
felt the sounds of water and wind press upon his ears,
he recognized in these sounds of nature the speech of his
mother. The murmuring pine trees on the shore of the
great sea, said “Minnewawa.” And above the murmuring
of the winds and the splashing of the water he found
his earliest childhood dreams once again in a woman,
“Minnehaha,” the laughing water. And the hero, before
all others, finds in woman the mother, in order to
become a child again, and, finally, to solve the riddle of
immortality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that Minnehaha’s father is a skilful arrow-maker
betrays him as the father of the hero (and the
woman he had with him as the mother). The father of
the hero is very often a skilful carpenter, or other
artisan. According to an Arabian legend, Tare,<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c008'><sup>[651]</sup></a> Abraham’s
father, was a skilful master workman, who could
carve arrows from any wood; that is to say, in the
Arabian form of speech, he was a procreator of splendid
sons.<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c008'><sup>[652]</sup></a> Moreover, he was a maker of images of gods.
Tvashtar, Agni’s father, is the maker of the world, a
smith and carpenter, the discoverer of fire-boring. Joseph,
the father of Jesus, was also a carpenter; likewise
Kinyras, Adonis’s father, who is said to have invented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>the hammer, the lever, roofing and mining. Hephaestus,
the father of Hermes, is an artistic master workman and
sculptor. In fairy tales, the father of the hero is very
modestly the traditional wood-cutter. These conceptions
were also alive in the cult of Osiris. There the divine
image was carved out of a tree trunk and then placed
within the hollow of the tree. (Frazer: “Golden
Bough,” Part IV.) In Rigveda, the world was also hewn
out of a tree by the world-sculptor. The idea that the
hero is his own procreator<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c008'><sup>[653]</sup></a> leads to the fact that he is
invested with paternal attributes, and reversedly the heroic
attributes are given to the father. In Mânî there
exists a beautiful union of the motives. He accomplishes
his great labors as a religious founder, hides himself for
years in a cave, he dies, is skinned, stuffed and hung up
(hero). Besides he is an artist, and has a crippled foot.
A similar union of motives is found in Wieland, the
smith.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hiawatha kept silent about what he saw at the old
arrow-maker’s on his return to Nokomis, and he did
nothing further to win Minnehaha. But now something
happened, which, if it were not in an Indian epic, would
rather be sought in the history of a neurosis. Hiawatha
introverted his libido; that is to say, he fell into an extreme
resistance against the “real sexual demand”
(Freud); he built a hut for himself in the wood, in order
to fast there and to experience dreams and visions. For
the first three days he wandered, as once in his earliest
youth, through a forest and looked at all the animals
and plants:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>“‘Master of life!’ he cried, desponding,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Must our lives depend on these things?’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The question whether our lives must depend upon
“these things” is very strange. It sounds as if life were
derived from these things; that is to say, from nature
in general. Nature seems suddenly to have assumed a
very strange significance. This phenomenon can be explained
only through the fact that a great amount of
libido was stored up and now is given to nature. As is
well known, men of even dull and prosy minds, in the
springtime of love, suddenly become aware of nature,
and even make poems about it. But we know that libido,
prevented from an actual way of transference, always reverts
to an earlier way of transference. Minnehaha, the
laughing water, is so clearly an allusion to the mother
that the secret yearning of the hero for the mother is
powerfully touched. Therefore, without having undertaken
anything, he goes home to Nokomis; but there again
he is driven away, because Minnehaha already stands in
his path.</p>

<p class='c007'>He turns, therefore, even further away, into that early
youthful period, the tones of which recall Minnehaha
most forcibly to his thoughts, where he learnt to hear
the mother-sounds in the sounds of nature. In this very
strange revival of the impressions of nature we recognize
a regression to those earliest and strongest nature impressions
which stand next to the subsequently extinguished,
even stronger, impressions which the child received
from the mother. The glamour of this feeling for
her is transferred to other objects of the childish environment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>(father’s house, playthings, etc.), from which later
those magic blissful feelings proceed, which seem to be
peculiar to the earliest childish memories. When, therefore,
Hiawatha hides himself in the lap of nature, it is
really the mother’s womb, and it is to be expected that he
will emerge again new-born in some form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before turning to this new creation arising from introversion,
there is still a further significance of the preceding
question to be considered: whether life is dependent
upon “these things”? Life may depend upon
these things in the degree that they serve <em>for nourishment</em>.
We must infer in this case that suddenly the question
of nutrition came very near the hero’s heart. (This
possibility will be thoroughly proven in what follows.)
The question of nutrition, indeed, enters seriously into
consideration. First, because regression to the mother
necessarily revives that special path of transference;
namely, that of nutrition through the mother. As soon
as the libido regresses to the presexual stage, there we
may expect to see the function of nutrition and its symbols
put in place of the sexual function. Thence is derived
an essential root of the displacement from below
upwards (Freud), because, in the presexual stage, the
principal value belongs not to the genitals, but to
the mouth. Secondly, because the hero fasted, his
hunger becomes predominant. Fasting, as is well known,
is employed to silence sexuality; also, it expresses symbolically
the resistance against sexuality, translated into
the language of the presexual stage. On the fourth day
of his fast the hero ceased to address himself to nature;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>he lay exhausted, with half-closed eyes, upon his couch,
sunk deep in dreams, the picture of extreme introversion.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already seen that, in such circumstances, an
infantile internal equivalent for reality appears, in the
place of external life and reality. This is also the case
with Hiawatha:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And he saw a youth approaching,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dressed in garments green and yellow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Coming through the purple twilight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the splendor of the sunset;</div>
      <div class='line'>Plumes of green bent o’er his forehead,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his hair was soft and golden.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This remarkable apparition reveals himself in the following
manner to Hiawatha:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“From the Master of Life descending,</div>
      <div class='line'>I, the friend of man, Mondamin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Come to warn you and instruct you,</div>
      <div class='line'>How by struggle and by labor</div>
      <div class='line'>You shall gain what you have prayed for.</div>
      <div class='line'>Rise up from your bed of branches;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mondamin is the maize: a god, who is eaten, arising
from Hiawatha’s introversion. His hunger, taken in a
double sense, his longing for the nourishing mother, gives
birth from his soul to another hero, the edible maize, the
son of the earth mother. Therefore, he again arises at
sunset, symbolizing the entrance into the mother, and in
the western sunset glow he begins again the mystic struggle
with the self-created god, the god who has originated
entirely from the longing for the nourishing mother.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>The struggle is again the struggle for liberation from this
destructive and yet productive longing. Mondamin is,
therefore, equivalent to the mother, and the struggle with
him means the overpowering and impregnation of the
mother. This interpretation is entirely proven by a
myth of the Cherokees, “who invoke it (the maize)
under the name of ‘The Old Woman,’ in allusion to a
myth that it sprang from the blood of an old woman
killed by her disobedient sons”:<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c008'><sup>[654]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Faint with famine, Hiawatha</div>
      <div class='line'>Started from his bed of branches,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the twilight of his wigwam</div>
      <div class='line'>Forth into the flush of sunset</div>
      <div class='line'>Came, and wrestled with Mondamin;</div>
      <div class='line'>At his touch he felt new courage</div>
      <div class='line'>Throbbing in his brain and bosom,</div>
      <div class='line'>Felt new life and hope and vigor</div>
      <div class='line'>Run through every nerve and fibre.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The battle at sunset with the god of the maize gives
Hiawatha new strength; and thus it must be, because the
fight for the individual depths, against the paralyzing
longing for the mother, gives creative strength to men.
Here, indeed, is the source of all creation, but it demands
heroic courage to fight against these forces and to wrest
from them the “treasure difficult to attain.” He who
succeeds in this has, in truth, attained the best. Hiawatha
wrestles with himself for his creation.<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c008'><sup>[655]</sup></a> The struggle
lasts again the charmed three days. The fourth day, just
as Mondamin prophesied, Hiawatha conquers him, and
Mondamin sinks to the ground in death. As Mondamin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>previously desired, Hiawatha digs his grave in mother
earth, and soon afterwards from this grave the young
and fresh maize grows for the nourishment of mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concerning the thought of this fragment, we have
therein a beautiful parallel to the mystery of Mithra,
where first the battle of the hero with his bull occurs.
Afterwards Mithra carries in “transitus” the bull into
the cave, where he kills him. From this death all fertility
grows, all that is edible.<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c008'><sup>[656]</sup></a> The cave corresponds
to the grave. The same idea is represented in the Christian
mysteries, although generally in more beautiful
human forms. The soul struggle of Christ in Gethsemane,
where he struggles with himself in order to complete
his work, then the “transitus,” the carrying of the
cross,<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c008'><sup>[657]</sup></a> where he takes upon himself the symbol of the
destructive mother, and therewith takes himself to the
sacrificial grave, from which, after three days, he triumphantly
arises; all these ideas express the same fundamental
thoughts. Also, the symbol of eating is not lacking
in the Christian mystery. Christ is a god who is eaten
in the Lord’s Supper. His death transforms him into
bread and wine, which we partake of in grateful memory
of his great deed.<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c008'><sup>[658]</sup></a> The relation of Agni to the Somadrink
and that of Dionysus to wine<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c008'><sup>[659]</sup></a> must not be omitted
here. An evident parallel is Samson’s rending of the
lion, and the subsequent inhabitation of the dead lion by
honey bees, which gives rise to the well-known German
riddle:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Speise ging von dem Fresser und Süssigkeit von dem Starken</span>
(Food went from the glutton and sweet from the strong).”<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c008'><sup>[660]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>In the Eleusinian mysteries these thoughts seem to
have played a rôle. Besides Demeter and Persephone,
Iakchos is a chief god of the Eleusinian cult; he was the
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">puer æternus</span>,” the eternal boy, of whom Ovid says the
following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tu puer æternus, tu formosissimus alto</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conspiceris cœlo tibi, cum sine cornibus astas,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virgineum caput est</span>,” etc.<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c008'><sup>[661]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the great Eleusinian festival procession the image
of Iakchos was carried. It is not easy to say which god
is Iakchos, possibly a boy, or a new-born son, similar to
the Etrurian Tages, who bears the surname “the freshly
ploughed boy,” because, according to the myth, he arose
from the furrow of the field behind the peasant, who was
ploughing. This idea shows unmistakably the Mondamin
motive. The plough is of well-known phallic meaning;
the furrow of the field is personified by the Hindoos as
woman. The psychology of this idea is that of a coitus,
referred back to the presexual stage (stage of nutrition).
The son is the edible fruit of the field. Iakchos
passes, in part, as son of Demeter or of Persephone,
also appropriately as consort of Demeter. (Hero as procreator
of himself.) He is also called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τῆς Δήμητρος
δαίμων</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δαίμων</span> equals libido, also Mother libido.) He
was identified with Dionysus, especially with the Thracian
Dionysus-Zagreus, of whom a typical fate of rebirth was
related. Hera had goaded the Titans against Zagreus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>who, assuming many forms, sought to escape them, until
they finally took him when he had taken on the form of a
bull. In this form he was killed (Mithra sacrifice) and
dismembered, and the pieces were thrown into a cauldron;
but Zeus killed the Titans by lightning, and swallowed
the still-throbbing heart of Zagreus. Through this
act he gave him existence once more, and Zagreus as
Iakchos again came forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Iakchos carries the torch, the phallic symbol of procreation,
as Plato testifies. In the festival procession, the
sheaf of corn, the cradle of Iakchos, was carried.
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λῖκνον</span>, mystica vannus Iacchi.) The Orphic legend<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c008'><sup>[662]</sup></a>
relates that Iakchos was brought up by Persephone, when,
after three years’ slumber in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λῖκνον</span>,<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c008'><sup>[663]</sup></a> he awoke. This
statement distinctly suggests the Mondamin motive. The
20th of Boedromion (the month Boedromion lasts from
about the 5th of September to the 5th of October) is
called Iakchos, in honor of the hero. On the evening
of this day the great torchlight procession took place on
the seashore, in which the quest and lament of Demeter
was represented. The rôle of Demeter, who, seeking
her daughter, wanders over the whole earth without food
or drink, has been taken over by Hiawatha in the Indian
epic. He turns to all created things without obtaining an
answer. As Demeter first learns of her daughter from
the subterranean Hecate, so does Hiawatha first find the
one sought for, Mondamin,<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c008'><sup>[664]</sup></a> in the deepest introversion
(descent to the mother). Hiawatha produces from himself,
Mondamin, as a mother produces the son. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>longing for the mother also includes the producing
mother (first devouring, then birth-giving). Concerning
the real contents of the mysteries, we learn through
the testimony of Bishop Asterius, about 390 A.D., the
following:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Is not there (in Eleusis) the gloomiest descent, and the most
solemn communion of the hierophant and the priestess; between
him and her alone? Are the torches not extinguished, and does
not the vast multitude regard as their salvation that which takes
place between the two in the darkness?”<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c008'><sup>[665]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>That points undoubtedly to a ritual marriage, which was
celebrated subterraneously in mother earth. The Priestess
of Demeter seems to be the representative of the earth
goddess, perhaps the furrow of the field.<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c008'><sup>[666]</sup></a> The descent
into the earth is also the symbol of the mother’s womb,
and was a widespread conception under the form of
cave worship. Plutarch relates of the Magi that they
sacrificed to Ahriman, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰς τόπον ἀνήλιον</span>.<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c008'><sup>[667]</sup></a> Lukian lets
the magician Mithrobarzanes <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰς χωρίον ἔρημον καὶ
ὑλῶδες καὶ ἀνήλιον</span>,<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c008'><sup>[668]</sup></a> descend into the bowels of the earth.
According to the testimony of Moses of the Koran, the
sister Fire and the brother Spring were worshipped in
Armenia in a cave. Julian gave an account from the
Attis legend of a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατάβασις εἰς ἄντρον</span>,<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c008'><sup>[669]</sup></a> from whence
Cybele brings up her son lover, that is to say, gives birth
to him.<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c008'><sup>[670]</sup></a> The cave of Christ’s birth, in Bethlehem
(‘House of Bread’), is said to have been an Attis
spelæum.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>A further Eleusinian symbolism is found in the festival
of Hierosgamos, in the form of the <em>mystic chests</em>, which,
according to the testimony of Clemens of Alexandria,
may have contained pastry, salt and fruits. The synthema
(confession) of the mystic transmitted by Clemens is suggestive
in still other directions:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have fasted, I have drunk of the barleydrink, I have taken
from the chest and after I have labored, I have placed it back in
the basket, and from the basket into the chest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The question as to what lay in the chest is explained
in detail by Dieterich.<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c008'><sup>[671]</sup></a> The labor he considers a phallic
activity, which the mystic has to perform. In fact, representations
of the mystic basket are given, wherein lies
a phallus surrounded by fruits.<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c008'><sup>[672]</sup></a> Upon the so-called
Lovatelli tomb vase, the sculptures of which are understood
to be Eleusinian ceremonies, it is shown how a
mystic caressed the serpent entwining Demeter. The
caressing of the fear animal indicates a religious conquering
of incest.<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c008'><sup>[673]</sup></a> According to the testimony of Clemens of
Alexandria, a serpent was in the chest. The serpent in
this connection is naturally of phallic nature, the phallus
which is forbidden in relation to the mother. Rohde
mentions that in the Arrhetophories, pastry, in the form
of phalli and serpents, were thrown into the cave near
the Thesmophorion. This custom was a petition for the
bestowal of children and harvest.<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c008'><sup>[674]</sup></a> The snake also plays
a large part in initiations under the remarkable title
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ διὰ κόλπου θεός</span>.<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c008'><sup>[675]</sup></a> Clemens observes that the symbol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>of the Sabazios mysteries is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ διὰ κόλπων θεός, δράκων
δὲ ἐστι καὶ οὗτος διελκόμενος τοῦ κόλπου τῶν τελουμένων</span>.<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c008'><sup>[676]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Through Arnobius we learn:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aureus coluber in sinum demittitur consecratis et eximitur
rursus ab inferioribus partibus atque imis.</span>”<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c008'><sup>[677]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the Orphic Hymn 52, Bacchus is invoked by
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑποκόλπιε</span>,<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c008'><sup>[678]</sup></a> which indicates that the god enters into
man as if through the female genitals.<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c008'><sup>[679]</sup></a> According to
the testimony of Hippolytus, the hierophant in the mystery
exclaimed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερον ἔτεκε πότνια κοῦρον, Βριμὼ βριμόν</span>
(the revered one has brought forth a holy boy, Brimos
from Brimo). This Christmas gospel, “Unto us a son
is born,” is illustrated especially through the tradition<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c008'><sup>[680]</sup></a>
that the Athenians “secretly show to the partakers in
the Epoptia, the great and wonderful and most perfect
Epoptic mystery, <em>a mown stalk of wheat</em>.”<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c008'><sup>[681]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The parallel for the motive of death and resurrection
is the motive of losing and finding. The motive appears
in religious rites in exactly the same connection, namely,
in spring festivities similar to the Hierosgamos, where
the image of the god was hidden and found again. It is
an uncanonical tradition that Moses left his father’s
house when twelve years old to teach mankind. In a
similar manner Christ is lost by his parents, and they
find him again as a teacher of wisdom, just as in the Mohammedan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>legend Moses and Joshua lose the fish, and
in his place Chidher, the teacher of wisdom, appears
(like the boy Jesus in the temple); so does the corn god,
lost and believed to be dead, suddenly arise again from
his mother into renewed youth. (That Christ was laid
in the manger is suggestive of fodder. Robertson, therefore,
places the manger as parallel to the liknon.)</p>

<p class='c007'>We understand from these accounts why the Eleusinian
mysteries were for the mystic so rich in comfort for
the hope of a better world. A beautiful Eleusinian epitaph
shows this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Truly, a beautiful secret is proclaimed by the blessed Gods!</div>
      <div class='line'>Mortality is not a curse, but death a blessing!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The hymn to Demeter<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c008'><sup>[682]</sup></a> in the mysteries also says the
same:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Blessed is he, the earth-born man, who hath seen this!</div>
      <div class='line'>Who hath not shared in these divine ceremonies,</div>
      <div class='line'>He hath an unequal fate in the obscure darkness of death.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Immortality is inherent in the Eleusinian symbol; in a
church song of the nineteenth century by Samuel Preiswerk
we discover it again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The world is yours, Lord Jesus,</div>
      <div class='line'>The world, on which we stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because it is thy world</div>
      <div class='line'>It cannot perish.</div>
      <div class='line'>Only the wheat, before it comes</div>
      <div class='line'>Up to the light in its fertility,</div>
      <div class='line'>Must die in the bosom of the earth</div>
      <div class='line'>First freed from its own nature.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>“Thou goest, O Lord, our chief,</div>
      <div class='line'>To heaven through thy sorrows,</div>
      <div class='line'>And guide him who believes</div>
      <div class='line'>In thee on the same path.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then take us all equally</div>
      <div class='line'>To share in thy sorrows and kingdoms,</div>
      <div class='line'>Guide us through thy gate of death,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bring thy world into the light.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Firmicus relates concerning the Attis mysteries:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nocte quadam simulacrum in lectica supinum ponitur et per
numeros digestis fletibus plangitur; deinde cum se ficta lamentatione
satiaverint, lumen infertur: tunc a sacerdote omnium qui
flebant fauces unguentur, quibus perunctis sacerdos hoc lento murmure
susurrat</span>: ‘<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θαρρεῖτε μύσται τοῦ Θεοῦ σεσωσμένου ἔσται γὰρ ἡμῖν ἐκ πόνου
σωτηρία</span>.’”<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c008'><sup>[683]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Such parallels show how little human personality and
how much divine, that is to say, universally human, is
found in the Christ mystery. No man is or, indeed, ever
was, a hero, for the hero is a god, and, therefore, impersonal
and generally applicable to all. Christ is a
“spirit,” as is shown in the very early Christian interpretation.
In different places of the earth, and in the
most varied forms and in the coloring of various periods,
the Savior-hero appears as a fruit of the entrance of the
libido into the personal maternal depths. The Bacchian
consecrations represented upon the Farnese relief contain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>a scene where a mystic wrapped in a mantle, drawn over
his head, was led to Silen, who holds the “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λῖχνον</span>”
(chalice), covered with a cloth. The covering of the
head signifies death. The mystic dies, figuratively, like
the seed corn, grows again and comes to the corn harvest.
Proclus relates that the mystics were buried up to
their necks. The Christian church as a place of religious
ceremony is really nothing but the grave of a hero (catacombs).
The believer descends into the grave, in order
to rise from the dead with the hero. That the meaning
underlying the church is that of the mother’s womb can
scarcely be doubted. The symbols of Mass are so distinct
that the mythology of the sacred act peeps out
everywhere. It is the magic charm of rebirth. The veneration
of the Holy Sepulchre is most plain in this respect.
A striking example is the Holy Sepulchre of St.
Stefano in Bologna. The church itself, a very old polygonal
building, consists of the remains of a temple to Isis.
The interior contains an artificial spelæum, a so-called
Holy Sepulchre, into which one creeps through a very
little door. After a long sojourn, the believer reappears
reborn from this mother’s womb. An Etruscan ossuarium
in the archeological museum in Florence is at the same
time a statue of Matuta, the goddess of death; the clay
figure of the goddess is hollowed within as a receptacle
for the ashes. The representations indicate that Matuta
is the mother. Her chair is adorned with sphinxes, as a
fitting symbol for the mother of death.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>Only a few of the further deeds of Hiawatha can interest
us here. Among these is the battle with Mishe-Nahma, the fish-king, in the eighth song. This deserves
to be mentioned as a typical battle of the sun-hero.
Mishe-Nahma is a fish monster, who dwells at the bottom
of the waters. Challenged by Hiawatha to battle, he devours
the hero, together with his boat:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is the typical myth of the work of the hero, distributed
over the entire world. He takes to a boat, fights
with the sea monster, is devoured, he defends himself
against being bitten or crushed<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c008'><sup>[684]</sup></a> (resistance or stamping
motive); having arrived in the interior of the “whale
dragon,” he seeks the vital organ, which he cuts off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>or in some way destroys. Often the death of the
monster occurs as the result of a fire which the hero
secretly makes within him; he mysteriously creates in the
womb of death life, the rising sun. Thus dies the fish,
which drifts ashore, where, with the assistance of
“birds,” the hero again attains the light of day.<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c008'><sup>[685]</sup></a> The
bird in this sense probably means the reascent of the sun,
the longing of the libido, the rebirth of the phœnix.
(The longing is very frequently represented by the symbol
of hovering.) The sun symbol of the bird rising from
the water is (etymologically) contained in the singing
swan. “Swan” is derived from the root <em>sven</em>, like
sun and tone. (See the preceding.) This act signifies
rebirth, and the bringing forth of life from the mother,<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c008'><sup>[686]</sup></a>
and by this means the ultimate destruction of death,
which, according to a Negro myth, has come into the
world, through the mistake of an old woman, who, at
the time of the general casting of skins (for men renewed
their youth through casting their skin like
snakes), drew on, through absent-mindedness, her old
skin instead of a new one, and as a result died. But the
effect of such an act could not be of any duration. Again
and again troubles of the hero are renewed, always under
the symbol of deliverance from the mother. Just as Hera
(as the pursuing mother) is the real source of the great
deeds of Hercules, so does Nokomis allow Hiawatha no
rest, and raises up new difficulties in his path, in form of
desperate adventures in which the hero may perhaps conquer,
but also, perhaps, may perish. The libido of mankind
is always in advance of his consciousness; unless his
libido calls him forth to new dangers he sinks into slothful
inactivity or, on the other hand, childish longing for
the mother overcomes him at the summit of his existence,
and he allows himself to become pitifully weak, instead
of striving with desperate courage towards the highest.
The mother becomes the demon, who summons the hero
to adventure, and who also places in his path the poisonous
serpent, which will strike him. Thus Nokomis, in the
ninth song, calls Hiawatha, points with her hand to the
west, where the sun sets in purple splendor, and says to
him:</p>

      <div class='line'>You can see his fiery serpents,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Kenabeek, the great serpents,</div>
      <div class='line'>Coiling, playing in the water.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This danger lurking in the west is known to mean
death, which no one, even the mightiest, escapes. This
magician, as we learn, also killed the father of Nokomis.
Now she sends her son forth to avenge the father
(Horus). Through the symbols attributed to the magician
it may easily be recognized what he symbolizes.
Snake and water belong to the mother, the snake as a
symbol of the repressed longing for the mother, or, in
other words, as a symbol of resistance, encircles protectingly
and defensively the maternal rock, inhabits the cave,
winds itself upwards around the mother tree and guards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>the precious hoard, the “mysterious” treasure. The
black Stygian water is, like the black, muddy spring of
Dhulqarnein, the place where the sun dies and enters into
rebirth, the maternal sea of death and night. On his
journey thither Hiawatha takes with him the magic oil
of Mishe-Nahma, which helps his boat through the waters
of death. (Also a sort of charm for immortality, like
the dragon’s blood for Siegfried, etc.)</p>

<p class='c007'>First, Hiawatha slays the great serpent. Of the
“night journey in the sea” over the Stygian waters it is
written:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All night long he sailed upon it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sailed upon that sluggish water,</div>
      <div class='line'>Covered with its mould of ages,</div>
      <div class='line'>Black with rotting water-rushes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rank with flags, and leaves of lilies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stagnant, lifeless, dreary, dismal,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lighted by the shimmering moonlight</div>
      <div class='line'>And by will-o’-the-wisps illumined,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled,</div>
      <div class='line'>In their weary night encampments.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The description plainly shows the character of a water
of death. The contents of the water point to an already
mentioned motive, that of encoiling and devouring. It is
said in the “Key to Dreams of Jagaddeva”:<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c008'><sup>[687]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“Whoever in dreams surrounds his body with bast, creepers or
ropes, with snake-skins, threads, or tissues, dies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I refer to the preceding arguments in regard to this.
Having come into the west land, the hero challenges the
magician to battle. A terrible struggle begins. Hiawatha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>is powerless, because Megissogwon is invulnerable.
At evening Hiawatha retires wounded, despairing
for a while, in order to rest:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>From whose branches trailed the mosses,</div>
      <div class='line'>And whose trunk was coated over</div>
      <div class='line'>With the Dead-man’s Moccasin-leather,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the fungus white and yellow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This protecting tree is described as coated over with
the moccasin leather of the dead, the fungus. This investing
of the tree with anthropomorphic attributes is also
an important rite wherever tree worship prevails, as, for
example, in India, where each village has its sacred tree,
which is clothed and in general treated as a human being.
The trees are anointed with fragrant waters, sprinkled
with powder, adorned with garlands and draperies. Just
as among men, the piercing of the <em>ears was performed
as an apotropaic charm against death, so does it occur
with the holy tree</em>. Of all the trees of India there is none
more sacred to the Hindoos than the Aswatha (Ficus religiosa).
It is known to them as Vriksha Raja (king of
trees), Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesvar live in it, and the
worship of it is the worship of the triad. Almost every
Indian village has an Aswatha,<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c008'><sup>[688]</sup></a> etc. This “village
linden tree,” well known to us, is here clearly characterized
as the mother symbol; it contains the three gods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hence, when Hiawatha retires to rest under the pine-tree,<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c008'><sup>[689]</sup></a>
it is a dangerous step, because he resigns himself
to the mother, whose garment is the garment of death
(the devouring mother). As in the whale-dragon, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>hero also in this situation needs a “helpful bird”; that
is to say, the helpful animals, which represent the benevolent
parents:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Suddenly from the boughs above him</div>
      <div class='line'>Sang the Mama, the woodpecker;</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Aim your arrows, Hiawatha,</div>
      <div class='line'>At the head of Megissogwon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Strike the tuft of hair upon it,</div>
      <div class='line'>At their roots the long black tresses;</div>
      <div class='line'>There alone can he be wounded.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Now, amusing to relate, Mama hurried to his help.
It is a peculiar fact that the woodpecker was also the
“Mama” of Romulus and Remus, who put nourishment
into the mouths of the twins with his beak.<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c008'><sup>[690]</sup></a> (Compare
with that the rôle of the vulture in Leonardo’s dream.
The vulture is sacred to Mars, like the woodpecker.)
With the maternal significance of the woodpecker, the
ancient Italian folk-superstition agrees: that from the
tree upon which this bird nested any nail which has been
driven in will soon drop out again.<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c008'><sup>[691]</sup></a> The woodpecker
owes its special significance to the circumstance that he
<em>hammers holes into trees</em>. (“To drive nails in,” as
above!) It is, therefore, understandable that he was
made much of in the Roman legend as an old king of
the country, a possessor or ruler of the holy tree, the
primitive image of the Paterfamilias. An old fable relates
how Circe, the spouse of King Picus, transformed
him into the Picus Martius, the woodpecker. The sorceress
is the “new-creating mother,” who has “magic influence”
upon the sun-husband. She kills him, transforms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>him into the soul-bird, the unfulfilled wish. Picus
was also understood as the wood demon and incubus, as
well as the soothsayer, all of which fully indicate the
mother libido.<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c008'><sup>[692]</sup></a> Picus was often placed on a par with
Picumnus by the ancients. Picumnus is the inseparable
companion of Pilumnus, and both are actually called <em>infantium
dii</em>, “the gods of little children.” Especially it
was said of Pilumnus that he defended new-born children
against the destroying attacks of the wood demon, Silvanus.
(Good and bad mother, the motive of the two
mothers.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The benevolent bird, a wish thought of deliverance
which arises from introversion,<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c008'><sup>[693]</sup></a> advises the hero to shoot
the magician under the hair, which is the only vulnerable
spot. This spot is the “phallic” point,<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c008'><sup>[694]</sup></a> if one may
venture to say so; it is at <em>the top of the head</em>, at the <em>place
where the mystic birth from the head takes place</em>, which
even to-day appears in children’s sexual theories. Into
that Hiawatha shoots (one may say, very naturally)
three arrows<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c008'><sup>[695]</sup></a> (the well-known phallic symbol), and thus
kills Megissogwon. Thereupon he steals the magic wampum
armor, which renders him invulnerable (means of
immortality). He significantly leaves the dead lying in
the water—because the magician is the fearful mother:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“On the shore he left the body,</div>
      <div class='line'>Half on land and half in water,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the sand his feet were buried,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his face was in the water.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus the situation is the same as with the fish king,
because the monster is the personification of the water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>of death, which in its turn represents the devouring
mother. This great deed of Hiawatha’s, where he has
vanquished the mother as the death-bringing demon,<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c008'><sup>[696]</sup></a>
is followed by his marriage with Minnehaha.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little fable which the poet has inserted in the later
song is noteworthy. An old man is transformed into a
youth, by <em>crawling through a hollow oak tree</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the fourteenth song is a description of how Hiawatha
discovers writing. I limit myself to the description
of two hieroglyphic tokens:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Gitche Manito the Mighty,</div>
      <div class='line'>He, the Master of Life, was painted</div>
      <div class='line'>As an egg, with points projecting</div>
      <div class='line'>To the four winds of the heavens.</div>
      <div class='line'>Everywhere is the Great Spirit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was the meaning of this symbol.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The world lies in the egg, which encompasses it at
every point; it is the cosmic woman with child, the symbol
of which Plato as well as the Vedas has made use of.
This mother is like the air, which is everywhere. But air
is spirit; the mother of the world is a spirit:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mitche Manito the Mighty,</div>
      <div class='line'>He the dreadful Spirit of Evil,</div>
      <div class='line'>As a serpent was depicted,</div>
      <div class='line'>As Kenabeek, the great serpent.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But the spirit of evil is fear, is the forbidden desire,
the adversary who opposes not only each individual heroic
deed, but life in its struggle for eternal duration as well,
and who introduces into our body the poison of weakness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>and age through the treacherous bite of the serpent.
It is all that is retrogressive, and as the model of our
first world is our mother, all retrogressive tendencies are
towards the mother, and, therefore, are disguised under
the incest image.</p>

<p class='c007'>In both these ideas the poet has represented in mythologic
symbols the libido arising from the mother and
the libido striving backward towards the mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a description in the fifteenth song how Chibiabos,
Hiawatha’s best friend, the amiable player and singer,
the embodiment of the joy of life, was enticed by the evil
spirits into ambush, fell through the ice and was drowned.
Hiawatha mourns for him so long that he succeeds, with
the aid of the magician, in calling him back again. But the
revivified friend is only a spirit, and he becomes master of
the land of spirits. (Osiris, lord of the underworld; the
two Dioscuri.) Battles again follow, and then comes the
loss of a second friend, Kwasind, the embodiment of
physical strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the twentieth song occur famine and the death of
Minnehaha, foretold by two taciturn guests from the
land of death; and in the twenty-second song Hiawatha
prepares for a final journey to the west land:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am going, O Nokomis,</div>
      <div class='line'>On a long and distant journey,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the portals of the Sunset,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the regions of the home-wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the Northwest-Wind Keewaydin.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“One long track and trail of splendor,</div>
      <div class='line'>Down whose stream, as down a river,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>Westward, westward, Hiawatha</div>
      <div class='line'>Sailed into the fiery sunset,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sailed into the purple vapors,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sailed into the dusk of evening.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thus departed Hiawatha,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hiawatha the Beloved,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the glory of the sunset,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the purple mists of evening,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the regions of the home-wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the Islands of the Blessed,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the kingdom of Ponemah,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the land of the Hereafter!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The sun, victoriously arising, tears itself away from
the embrace and clasp, from the enveloping womb of
the sea, and sinks again into the maternal sea, into night,
the all-enveloping and the all-reproducing, leaving behind
it the heights of midday and all its glorious works. This
image was the first, and was profoundly entitled to become
the symbolic carrier of human destiny; in the morning
of life man painfully tears himself loose from the
mother, from the domestic hearth, to rise through battle
to his heights. Not seeing his worst enemy in front of
him, but bearing him within himself as a deadly longing
for the depths within, for drowning in his own source,
for becoming absorbed into the mother, his life is a constant
struggle with death, a violent and transitory delivery
from the always lurking night. This death is no external
enemy, but a deep personal longing for quiet and for the
profound peace of non-existence, for a dreamless sleep
in the ebb and flow of the sea of life. Even in his highest
endeavor for harmony and equilibrium, for philosophic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>depths and artistic enthusiasm, he seeks death, immobility,
satiety and rest. If, like Peirithoos, he tarries too
long in this place of rest and peace, he is overcome by
torpidity, and the poison of the serpent paralyzes him for
all time. If he is to live he must fight and sacrifice his
longing for the past, in order to rise to his own heights.
And having reached the noonday heights, he must also
<em>sacrifice the love for his own achievement</em>, for he may not
loiter. The sun also sacrifices its greatest strength in
order to hasten onwards to the fruits of autumn, which
are the seeds of immortality; fulfilled in children, in
works, in posthumous fame, in a new order of things, all
of which in their turn begin and complete the sun’s
course over again.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Song of Hiawatha” contains, as these extracts
show, a material which is very well adapted to bring into
play the abundance of ancient symbolic possibilities,
latent in the human mind, and to stimulate it to the creation
of mythologic figures. But the products always contain the
same old problems of humanity, which rise again and again
in new symbolic disguise from the shadowy world of the
unconscious. Thus Miss Miller is reminded through the
longing of Chiwantopel, of another mythic cycle which
appeared in the form of Wagner’s “Siegfried.” Especially
is this shown in the passage in Chiwantopel’s monologue,
where he exclaims, “There is not one who understands
me, not one who resembles me, not one who has a
soul sister to mine.” Miss Miller observes that the
sentiment of this passage has the greatest analogy with
the feelings which Siegfried experienced for Brunhilde.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>This analogy causes us to cast a glance at the song of
Siegfried, especially at the relation of Siegfried and
Brunhilde. It is a well-recognized fact that Brunhilde,
the Valkyr, gives protection to the birth (incestuous)
of Siegfried, but while Sieglinde is the human mother,
Brunhilde has the rôle of “spiritual mother” (mother-imago);
however, unlike Hera towards Hercules, she is
not a pursuer, but benevolent. This sin, in which she is
an accomplice, by means of the help she renders, is the
reason for her banishment by Wotan. The strange birth
of Siegfried from the sister-wife distinguishes him as
Horus, as the <em>reborn son</em>, a reincarnation of the retreating
Osiris—Wotan. The birth of the young son, of the
hero, results, indeed, from mankind, who, however, are
merely the human bearers of the cosmic symbolism. Thus
the birth is protected by the spirit mother (Hera, Lilith):
she sends Sieglinde with the child in her womb (Mary’s
flight) on the “night journey on the sea” to the east:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Onward, hasten;</div>
      <div class='line'>Turn to the East.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O woman, thou cherishest</div>
      <div class='line'>The sublimest hero of the world</div>
      <div class='line'>In thy sheltering womb.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The motive of dismemberment is found again in the
broken sword of Siegmund, which was kept for Siegfried.
From the dismemberment life is pieced together
again. (The Medea wonder.) Just as a smith forges
the pieces together, so is the dismembered dead again
put together. (This comparison is also found in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>“Timaios” of Plato: the parts of the world joined
together with pegs.) In the Rigveda, 10, 72, the creator
of the world, Brahmanaspati, is a smith.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Brahmanaspati, as a blacksmith,</div>
      <div class='line'>Welded the world together.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The sword has the significance of the phallic sun power;
therefore, a sword proceeds from the mouth of the
apocalyptic Christ; that is to say, the procreative fire, the
word, or the procreative Logos. In Rigveda, Brahmanaspati
is also a prayer-word, which possessed an ancient
creative significance:<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c008'><sup>[697]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And this prayer of the singers, expanding from itself,</div>
      <div class='line'>Became a cow, which was already there before the world,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dwelling together in the womb of this god,</div>
      <div class='line'>Foster-children of the same keeper are the gods.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—<cite>Rigveda</cite> x: 31.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Logos became a cow; that is to say, the mother,
who is pregnant with the gods. (In Christian uncanonical
phantasies, where the Holy Ghost has feminine significance,
we have the well-known motive of the two
mothers, the earthly mother, Mary, and the spiritual
mother, the Holy Ghost.) The transformation of the
Logos into the mother is not remarkable in itself, because
the origin of the phenomenon fire-speech seems to be the
mother-libido, according to the discussion in the earlier
chapter. The <em>spiritual is the mother-libido</em>. The significance
of the sword, in the Sanskrit conception, têjas,
is probably partly determined by its sharpness, as is
shown above, in its connection with the libido conception.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>The motive of pursuit (the pursuing Sieglinde, analogous
to Leto) is not here bound up with the spiritual mother,
but with Wotan, therefore corresponding to the Linos
legend, where the father of the wife is also the pursuer.
Wotan is also the father of Brunhilde. Brunhilde stands
in a peculiar relation to Wotan. Brunhilde says to
Wotan:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thou speakest to the will of Wotan
By telling me what thou wishest:
Who&nbsp;... am I
Were I not thy will?”</p>

<p class='c017'><em>Wotan</em>:</p>

<p class='c017'>I take counsel only with myself,
When I speak with thee....</p>

<p class='c007'>Brunhilde is also somewhat the “angel of the face,”
that creative will or word,<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c008'><sup>[698]</sup></a> emanating from God, also
the Logos, which became the child-bearing woman. God
created the world through his word; that is to say, his
mother, the woman who is to bring him forth again.
(He lays his own egg.) This peculiar conception, it
seems to me, can be explained by assuming that the libido
overflowing into speech (thought) has preserved its
sexual character to an extraordinary degree as a result
of the inherent inertia. In this way the “word” had to
execute and fulfil all that was denied to the sexual wish;
namely, the return into the mother, in order to attain
eternal duration. The “word” fulfils this wish by itself
becoming the daughter, the wife, the mother of the God,
who brings him forth anew.<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c008'><sup>[699]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>Wagner has this idea vaguely in his mind in Wotan’s
lament over Brunhilde:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“None as she knew my inmost thought;</div>
      <div class='line'>None knew the source of my will</div>
      <div class='line'>As she;</div>
      <div class='line'>She herself was</div>
      <div class='line'>The creating womb of my wish;</div>
      <div class='line'>And so now she has broken</div>
      <div class='line'>The blessed union!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Brunhilde’s sin is the favoring of Siegmund, but, behind
this, lies incest: this is projected into the brother-sister
relation of Siegmund and Sieglinde; in reality, and
archaically expressed, Wotan, the father, has entered into
his self-created daughter, in order to rejuvenate himself.
But this fact must, of course, be veiled. Wotan is rightly
indignant with Brunhilde, for she has taken the Isis rôle
and through the birth of the son has deprived the old
man of his power. The first attack of the death serpent
in the form of the son, Siegmund, Wotan has repelled;
he has broken Siegmund’s sword, but Siegmund
rises again in a grandson. This inevitable fate is always
helped by the woman; hence the wrath of Wotan.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Siegfried’s birth Sieglinde dies, as is proper. The
foster-mother<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c008'><sup>[700]</sup></a> is apparently not a woman, but a chthonic
god, a crippled dwarf, who belongs to that tribe which
renounces love.<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c008'><sup>[701]</sup></a> The Egyptian god of the underworld,
the crippled shadow of Osiris (who celebrated a melancholy
resurrection in the sexless semi-ape Harpocrates),
is the tutor of Horus, who has to avenge the death of his
father.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>Meanwhile Brunhilde sleeps the enchanted sleep, like a
Hierosgamos, upon a mountain, where Wotan has put her
to sleep<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c008'><sup>[702]</sup></a> with the magic thorn (Edda), surrounded by
the flames of Wotan’s fire (equal to libido<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c008'><sup>[703]</sup></a>), which
wards off every one. But Mime becomes Siegfried’s
enemy and wills his death through Fafner. Here Mime’s
dynamic nature is revealed; he is a masculine representation
of the terrible mother, also a foster-mother of demoniac
nature, who places the poisonous worm (Typhon)
in her son’s (Horus’s) path. Siegfried’s longing for the
mother drives him away from Mime, and his travels begin
with the mother of death, and lead through vanquishing
the “terrible mother”<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c008'><sup>[704]</sup></a> to the woman:</p>

<p class='c007'>Siegfried decides to separate from the demon which
was the mother in the past, and he gropes forward with
the longing directed towards the mother. Nature acquires
a hidden maternal significance for him (“doe”);
in the tones of nature he discovers a suggestion of the
maternal voice and the maternal language:</p>

<p class='c007'>This psychology we have already encountered in Hiawatha.
By means of his dialogue with the bird (bird,
like wind and arrow, represents the wish, the winged
longing) Siegfried entices Fafner from the cave. His
desires turn back to the mother, and the chthonic demon,
the cave-dwelling terror of the woods, appears. Fafner
is the protector of the treasure; in his cave lies the hoard,
the source of life and power. The mother possesses the
libido of the son, and jealously does she guard it. Translated
into psychological language, this means the positive
transference succeeds only through the release of the
libido from the mother-imago, the incestuous object in
general. Only in this manner is it possible to gain one’s
libido, the incomparable treasure, and this requires a
mighty struggle, the whole battle of adaptation.<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c008'><sup>[705]</sup></a> The
Siegfried legend has abundantly described the outcome of
this battle with Fafner. According to the Edda, Siegfried
eats Fafner’s heart, the seat of life. He wins the
magic cap, through whose power Alberich had changed
himself into a serpent. This refers to the motive of casting
the skin, rejuvenation. By means of the magic cap
one can vanish and assume different shapes. The vanishing
probably refers to dying and to the invisible presence;
that is, existence in the mother’s womb. A luck-bringing
cap, amniotic covering, the new-born child occasionally
wears over his head (the caul). Moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>Siegfried drinks the dragon’s blood, which makes it possible
for him to understand the language of birds, and
consequently he enters into a peculiar relation with Nature,
a dominating position, the result of his knowledge,
and finally wins the treasure.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">Hort</span></i> is a mediæval and Old High German word with

Celtic <i><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">koudo</span></i> = concealment; Latin, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">occultatio</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The assumption of Kluge is also supported in other
directions; namely, from the point of view of the primitive
idea:</p>

<p class='c017'>“There exists in Athens<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c008'><sup>[708]</sup></a> a sacred place (a Temenos) of Ge,
with the surname Olympia. Here the ground is torn open for
about a yard in width; and they say, after the flood at the time
of Deucalion, that the water receded here; and every year they
throw into the fissure wheatmeal, kneaded with honey.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have observed previously that among the Arrhetophorian,
pastry in the form of snakes and phalli, was
thrown into a crevice in the earth. This was mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>in connection with the ceremonies of fertilizing the earth.
We have touched slightly already upon the sacrifice in
the earth crevice among the Watschandies. The flood
of death has passed characteristically into the crevice of
the earth; that is, back into the mother again; because
from the mother the universal great death has come in
the first place. The flood is simply the counterpart of the
vivifying and all-producing water: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὠκεανοῦ, ὅσπερ γένεσις
πάντεσσι τέτυκται</span>.<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c008'><sup>[709]</sup></a> One sacrifices the honey cake
to the mother, so that she may spare one from death.
Thus every year in Rome a gold sacrifice was thrown
into the lacus Curtius, into the former fissure in the earth,
which could only be closed through the sacrificial death
of Curtius. He was the typical hero, who has journeyed
into the underworld, in order to conquer the danger
threatening the Roman state from the opening of the
abyss. (Kaineus, Amphiaraos.) In the Amphiaraion of
Oropos those healed through the temple incubation threw
their gifts of gold into the sacred well, of which Pausanias
says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“If any one is healed of a sickness through a saying of the
oracle, then it is customary to throw a silver or gold coin into the
well; because here Amphiaraos has ascended as a god.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable that this oropic well is also the place of
his “Katabasis” (descent into the lower world). There
were many entrances into Hades in antiquity. Thus near
Eleusis there was an abyss, through which Aidoneus
passed up and down, when he kidnapped Cora. (Dragon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>and maiden: the libido overcome by resistance, life replaced
by death.) There were crevices in the rocks,
through which souls could ascend to the upper world. Behind
the temple of Chthonia in Hermione lay a sacred
district of Pluto, with a ravine through which Hercules
had brought up Cerberus; in addition, there was an
“Acherusian” lake.<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c008'><sup>[710]</sup></a> This ravine was, therefore, the
entrance to the place where death was conquered. The
lake also belongs here as a further mother symbol, for
symbols appear massed together, as they are surrogates,
and, therefore, do not afford the same satisfaction of desire
as accorded by reality, so that the unsatisfied remnant
of the libido must seek still further symbolic outlets.
The ravine in the Areopagus in Athens was considered
the seat of inhabitants of the lower world. An old
Grecian custom<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c008'><sup>[711]</sup></a> suggests a similar idea. Girls were
sent into a cavern, where a poisonous snake dwelt, as a
test of virginity. If they were bitten by the snake, it was
a token that they were no longer chaste. We find this
same motive again in the Roman legend of St. Silvester,
at the end of the fifth century:<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c008'><sup>[712]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erat draco immanissimus in monte Tarpeio, in quo est Capitolium
collocatum. Ad hunc draconem per CCCLXV gradus,
quasi ad infernum, magi cum virginibus sacrilegis descendebant
semel in mense cum sacrificiis et lustris, ex quibus esca poterat
tanto draconi inferri. Hic draco subito ex improviso ascendebat
et licet non ingrederetur vicinos tamen aeres flatu suo vitiabat.
Ex quo mortalitas hominum et maxima luctus de morte veniebat
infantum. (Lilith motive.) Sanctus itaque Silvester cum haberet
cum paganis pro defensione veritatis conflictum, ad hoc venit ut
dicerent ei pagani: ‘Silvester descende ad draconem et fac eum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>in nomine Dei tui vel uno anno ab interfectione generis humani
cessare.’</span>”<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c008'><sup>[713]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>St. Peter appeared to Silvester in a dream and advised
him to close his door to the underworld with chains, according
to the model in Revelation, chap, xx:</p>

<p class='c017'>(1) “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the
key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand.</p>

<p class='c017'>(2) “And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which
is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.</p>

<p class='c017'>(3) “And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up,
and set a seal upon him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The anonymous author of a writing, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Promissionibus</span>,”<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c008'><sup>[714]</sup></a>
of the beginning of the fifth century, mentions a
very similar legend:</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apud urbem Romam specus quidam fuit in quo draco miræ
magnitudinis mechanica arte formatus, gladium ore gestans,<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c008'><sup>[715]</sup></a>
oculis rutilantibus gemmis<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c008'><sup>[716]</sup></a> metuendus ac terribilis apparebat.
Hinc annuæ devotæ virgines floribus exornatæ, eo modo in sacrificio
dabantur, quatenus inscias munera deferentes gradum
scalæ, quo certe ille arte diaboli draco pendebat, contingentes impetus
venientis gladii perimeret, ut sanguinem funderet innocentem.
Et hunc quidam monachus, bene ob meritum cognitus
Stiliconi tunc patricio, eo modo subvertit; baculo, manu, singulos
gradus palpandos inspiciens, statim ut illum tangens fraudem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>diabolicam repperit, eo transgresso descendens, draconem scidit,
misitque in partes: ostendens et hie deos non esse qui manu
fiunt.</span>”<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c008'><sup>[717]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>hero battling with the dragon has much in common
with the dragon</em>, and also he takes over his qualities; for
example, invulnerability. As the footnotes show, the similarity
is carried still further (sparkling eyes, sword in his
mouth). Translated psychologically, the dragon is
merely the son’s repressed longing, striving towards the
mother; therefore, the son is the dragon, as even
Christ is identified with the serpent, which, once upon a
time, similia similibus, had controlled the snake plague
in the Wilderness. John iii: 14. <em>As a serpent he is
to be crucified; that is to say, as one striving backwards
towards the mother, he must die hanging or suspended
on the mother tree.</em> Christ and the dragon of the Antichrist
are in the closest contact in the history of their
appearance and their cosmic meaning. (Compare Bousset,
the Antichrist.) The legend of the dragon concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>in the Antichrist myth belongs to the life of the hero,
and, therefore, is immortal. In none of the newer forms
of myth are the pairs of opposites so perceptibly near as
in that of Christ and Antichrist. (I refer to the remarkable
psychologic description of this problem in Mereschkowski’s
romance, “Leonardo da Vinci.”) That the
dragon is only an artifice is a useful and delightfully
rationalistic conceit, which is most significant for that
period. In this way the dismal gods were effectually vulgarized.
The schizophrenic insane readily make use of this
mechanism, in order to depreciate efficient personalities.
One often hears the stereotyped lament, “It is all a play,
artificial, made up,” etc. A dream of a “schizophrenic”
is most significant; he is sitting in a dark room, which
has only a single small window, through which he can see
the sky. The sun and moon appear, but they are only
made artificially from oil paper. (Denial of the deleterious
incest influence.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The descent of the three hundred and sixty-five steps
refers to the sun’s course, to the cavern of death and rebirth.
That this cavern actually stands in a relation to
the subterranean mother of death can be shown by a note
in Malalas, the historian of Antioch,<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c008'><sup>[718]</sup></a> who relates that
Diocletian consecrated there a crypt to Hecate, to which
one descends by three hundred and sixty-five steps. Cave
mysteries seem to have been celebrated for Hecate in
Samothrace as well. The serpent also played a great part
as a regular symbolic attribute in the service of Hecate.
The mysteries of Hecate flourished in Rome towards the
end of the fourth century, so that the two foregoing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>legends might indeed relate to her cult. Hecate<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c008'><sup>[719]</sup></a> is a
real spectral goddess of night and phantoms, a Mar; she
is represented as riding, and in Hesiod occurs as the
<em>patron</em> of riders. She sends the horrible nocturnal fear
phantom, the Empusa, of whom Aristophanes says that
she appears inclosed in a <em>bladder swollen with blood</em>.
According to Libanius, the mother of Aischines is also
called Empusa, for the reason that “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκ σκοτεινῶν τόπων
τοῖς παισὶν καὶ ταῖς γυναιξίν ὡρμᾶτο</span>.”<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c008'><sup>[720]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Empusa, like Hecate, has <em>peculiar</em> feet; one foot is
made of brass, the other of ass’ dung. Hecate has snakelike
feet, which, as in the triple form ascribed to Hecate,
points to her phallic libido nature.<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c008'><sup>[721]</sup></a> In Tralles, Hecate
appears next to Priapus; there is also a Hecate Aphrodisias.
Her symbols are the key,<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c008'><sup>[722]</sup></a> the whip,<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c008'><sup>[723]</sup></a> the snake,<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c008'><sup>[724]</sup></a>
the dagger<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c008'><sup>[725]</sup></a> and the torch.<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c008'><sup>[726]</sup></a> As mother of death, dogs
accompany her, the significance of which we have previously
discussed at length. As guardian of the door of
Hades and as Goddess of dogs, she is of threefold form,
and really identified with Cerberus. Thus Hercules, in
bringing up Cerberus, brings the conquered mother of
death into the upper world. As spirit mother (moon!),
she sends madness, lunacy. (This mythical observation
states that “the mother” sends madness; by far the majority
of the cases of insanity consist, in fact, in the domination
of the individual by the material of the incest
phantasy.) In the mysteries of Cerberus, a rod,
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λευκόφυλλος</span>,<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c008'><sup>[727]</sup></a> was broken off. This rod protected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>the purity of virgins, and caused any one who touched
the plant to become insane. We recognize in this the
motive of the sacred tree, which, as mother, must not
be touched, an act which only an insane person would
commit. Hecate, as nightmare, appears in the form of
Empusa, in a vampire rôle, or as Lamia, as devourer of
men; perhaps, also, in that more beautiful guise, “The
Bride of Corinth.” She is the mother of all charms and
witches, the patron of Medea, because the power of the
“terrible mother” is magical and irresistible (working
upward from the unconscious). In Greek syncretism,
she plays a very significant rôle. She is confused with
Artemis, who also has the surname <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑκάτη</span>,<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c008'><sup>[728]</sup></a> “the one
striking at a distance” or “striking according to her
will,” in which we recognize again her superior power.
Artemis is the huntress, with hounds, and so Hecate,
through confusion with her, becomes <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυνηγετική</span>, the
wild nocturnal huntress. (God, as huntsman, see above.)
She has her name in common with Apollo, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕκατος
ἑκάεργος</span>.<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c008'><sup>[729]</sup></a> From the standpoint of the libido theory,
this connection is easily understandable, because Apollo
merely symbolizes the more positive side of the same
amount of libido. The confusion of Hecate with Brimo
as subterranean mother is understandable; also with
Persephone and Rhea, the primitive all-mother. Intelligible
through the maternal significance is the confusion
with Ilithyia, the midwife. Hecate is also the direct
goddess of births, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κουροτρόφος</span>,<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c008'><sup>[730]</sup></a> the multiplier of cattle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>and goddess of marriage. Hecate, orphically, occupies
the centre of the world as Aphrodite and Gaia,
even as the world soul in general. On a carved gem<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c008'><sup>[731]</sup></a>
she is represented carrying the cross on her head. The
beam on which the criminal was scourged is called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑκάτη</span>.<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c008'><sup>[732]</sup></a> To her, as to the Roman Trivia, the triple roads,
or <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Scheideweg</span></i>, “forked road,” or crossways were dedicated.
And where roads branch off or unite sacrifices of
dogs were brought her; there the bodies of the executed
were thrown; the sacrifice occurs at the <em>point of crossing</em>.
Etymologically, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">scheide</span></i>, “sheath”; for example, sword-sheath,
sheath for water-shed and sheath for vagina, is
identical with <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">scheiden</span></i>, “to split,” or “to separate.” The
meaning of a sacrifice at this place would, therefore, be
as follows: to offer something to the mother at the place
of junction or at the fissure. (Compare the sacrifice to
the chthonic gods in the abyss.) The Temenos of Ge, the
abyss and the well, are easily understood as the gates of
life and death,<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c008'><sup>[733]</sup></a> “past which every one gladly creeps”
(Faust), and sacrifices there his obolus or his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πελανοί</span>,<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c008'><sup>[734]</sup></a>
instead of his body, just as Hercules soothes Cerberus
with the honey cakes. (Compare with this the mythical
significance of the dog!) Thus the crevice at Delphi,
with the spring, Castalia, was the seat of the chthonic
dragon, Python, who was conquered by the sun-hero,
Apollo. (Python, incited by Hera, pursued Leta, pregnant
with Apollo; but she, on the floating island of Delos
[nocturnal journey on the sea], gave birth to her child,
who later slew the Python; that is to say, conquered in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>it the spirit mother.) In Hierapolis (Edessa) the temple
was erected above the crevice through which the flood
had poured out, and in Jerusalem the foundation stone
of the temple covered the great abyss,<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c008'><sup>[735]</sup></a> just as Christian
churches are frequently built over caves, grottoes, wells,
etc. In the Mithra grotto,<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c008'><sup>[736]</sup></a> and all the other sacred
caves up to the Christian catacombs, which owe their
significance not to the legendary persecutions but to the
worship of the dead,<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c008'><sup>[737]</sup></a> we come across the same fundamental
motive. The burial of the dead in a holy place
(in the “garden of the dead,” in cloisters, crypts, etc.)
is restitution to the mother, with the certain hope of resurrection
by which such burial is rightfully rewarded.
The animal of death which dwells in the cave had to be
soothed in early times through human sacrifices; later
with natural gifts.<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c008'><sup>[738]</sup></a> Therefore, the Attic custom gives
to the dead the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μελιτοῦττα</span>, to pacify the dog of hell,
the three-headed monster at the gate of the underworld.
A more recent elaboration of the natural gifts seems to be
the obolus for Charon, who is, therefore, designated by
Rohde as the second Cerberus, corresponding to the
Egyptian dog-faced god Anubis.<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c008'><sup>[739]</sup></a> Dog and serpent of
the underworld (Dragon) are likewise identical. In
the tragedies, the Erinnyes are serpents as well as dogs;
the serpents Tychon and Echnida are parents of the serpents—Hydra,
the dragon of the Hesperides, and Gorgo;
and of the dogs, Cerberus, Orthrus, Scylla.<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c008'><sup>[740]</sup></a> Serpents
and dogs are also protectors of the treasure. The
chthonic god was probably always a serpent dwelling in a
cave, and was fed with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πελανοί</span>.<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c008'><sup>[741]</sup></a> In the Asclepiadean of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>the later period, the sacred serpents were scarcely visible,
meaning that they probably existed only figuratively.<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c008'><sup>[742]</sup></a>
Nothing was left but the hole in which the snake was
said to dwell. There the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πελανοί</span><a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c008'><sup>[743]</sup></a> were placed; later
the obolus was thrown in. The sacred cavern in the
temple of Kos consisted of a rectangular pit, upon which
was laid a stone lid, with a square hole; this arrangement
serves the purpose of a treasure house. The snake hole
had become a slit for money, a “sacrificial box,” and the
cave had become a “treasure.” That this development,
which Herzog traces, agrees excellently with the actual
condition is shown by a discovery in the temple of Asclepius
and Hygieia in Ptolemais:</p>

<p class='c017'>“An encoiled granite snake, with arched neck, was found. In
the middle of the coil is seen a narrow slit, polished by usage,
just large enough to allow a coin of four centimeters diameter at
most to fall through. At the side are holes for handles to lift the
heavy pieces, the under half of which is used as a cover.”—<em>Herzog</em>,
<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 212.</p>

<p class='c007'>The serpent, as protector of the hoard, now lies on the
treasure house. The fear of the maternal womb of
death has become the guardian of the treasure of life.
That the snake in this connection is really a symbol of
death, that is to say, of the dead libido, results from the
fact that the souls of the dead, like the chthonic gods, appear
as <em>serpents</em>, as dwellers in the kingdom of the mother
of death.<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c008'><sup>[744]</sup></a> This development of symbol allows us to recognize
easily the transition of the originally very primitive
significance of the crevice in the earth as mother to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>meaning of treasure house, and can, therefore, support the
etymology of <em>Hort</em>, “hoard, treasure,” as suggested by
Kluge, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεύθω</span>, belonging to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κὲῦθος</span>, means the innermost
womb of the earth (Hades); <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύσθος</span>, that Kluge adds,
is of similar meaning, cavity or womb. Prellwitz does
not mention this connection. Fick,<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c008'><sup>[745]</sup></a> however, compares
New High German <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">hort</span></i>, Gothic <i><span lang="got" xml:lang="got">huzd</span></i>, to Armenian <i><span lang="hy" xml:lang="hy">kust</span></i>,

<p class='c007'>The treasure which the hero fetches from the dark

from the anxiety of pregnancy and the birth throes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>Thus the Hindoo fire-bringer is called Mâtariçvan, meaning
the one swelling in the mother. The <em>hero striving
towards the mother is the dragon, and when he separates
from the mother he becomes the conqueror of the
dragon</em>.<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c008'><sup>[748]</sup></a> This train of thought, which we have already
hinted at previously in Christ and Antichrist, may be
traced even into the details of Christian phantasy. There
is a series of mediæval pictures<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c008'><sup>[749]</sup></a> in which the communion
cup contains a dragon, a snake or some sort of
small animal.<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c008'><sup>[750]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The cup is the receptacle, the maternal womb, of the
god resurrected in the wine; the cup is the cavern where
the serpent dwells, the god who sheds his skin, in the
state of metamorphosis; for Christ is also the serpent.
These symbolisms are used in an obscure connection in
I Corinthians, verse 10: Paul writes of the Jews who
“were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the
sea” (also reborn) and “did all drink the same spiritual
drink; for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed
them, and that rock was Christ.” They drank from the
mother (the generative rock, birth from the rock) the
milk of rejuvenation, the mead of immortality, and this
Rock was Christ, here identified with the mother, because
he is the symbolic representative of the mother libido.
When we drink from the cup, then we drink from the
mother’s breast immortality and everlasting salvation.
Paul wrote of the Jews that they ate and then rose up
to dance and to indulge in fornication, and then twenty-three
thousand of them were swept off by the plague of
serpents. The remedy for the survivors, however, was
the sight of a serpent hanging on a pole. From it was
derived the cure.</p>

communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one
bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of one bread.”—<em>I
Corinthians</em> x: 16, 17.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bread and wine are the body and the blood of Christ;
the food of the immortals who are brothers with Christ,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀδελφοί</span>, those who come from the same womb. We
who are reborn again from the mother are all heroes
together with Christ, and enjoy immortal food. As with
the Jews, so too with the Christians, there is imminent
danger of unworthy partaking, for this mystery, which is
very closely related psychologically with the subterranean
Hierosgamos of Eleusis, involves a mysterious union of
man in a spiritual sense,<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c008'><sup>[751]</sup></a> which was constantly misunderstood
by the profane and was retranslated into his
language, where mystery is equivalent to orgy and
secrecy to vice.<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c008'><sup>[752]</sup></a> A very interesting blasphemer and sectarian
of the beginning of the nineteenth century named
Unternährer has made the following comment on the
last supper:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The communion of the devil is in this brothel. All they sacrifice
here, they sacrifice to the devil and not to God. There they
have the devil’s cup and the devil’s dish; <em>there they have sucked
the head of the snake</em>,<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c008'><sup>[753]</sup></a> there they have fed upon the iniquitous
bread and drunken the wine of wickedness.”<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c008'><sup>[754]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Unternährer is an adherent or a forerunner of the
“theory of living one’s own nature.” He dreams of himself
as a sort of priapic divinity; he says of himself:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>“Black-haired, very charming and handsome in countenance,
and every one enjoys listening to thee on account of the amiable
speeches which come from thy mouth; therefore the maids love
thee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He preaches “the cult of nakedness.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Ye fools and blind men, behold God has created man in his
image, as male and female, and has blessed them and said, ‘Be
fruitful and multiply and fill the earth, and make it subject to
thee.’ Therefore, he has given the greatest honor to these poor
members and has placed them naked in the garden,” etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Now are the fig leaves and the covering removed, because
thou hast turned to the Lord, for the Lord is the Spirit, and where
the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom,<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c008'><sup>[755]</sup></a> there the clearness
of the Lord is mirrored with uncovered countenance. This is
precious before God, and this is the glory of the Lord, and the
adornment of our God, when you stand in the image and honor
of your God, as God created you, naked and not ashamed.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Who can ever praise sufficiently in the sons and daughters
of the living God those parts of the body which are destined to
procreate?</p>

<p class='c017'>“In the lap of the daughters of Jerusalem is the gate of the
Lord, and the Just will go into the temple there, to the altar.<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c008'><sup>[756]</sup></a>
And in the lap of the sons of the living God is the water-pipe of
the upper part, which is a tube, like a rod, to measure the temple
and altar. And under the water-tube the sacred stones are placed,
as a sign and testimony of the Lord, who has taken to himself the
seed of Abraham.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Out of the seeds in the chamber of the mother, God creates
a man with his hands, as an image of himself. Then the mother
house and the mother chamber is opened in the daughters of the
Living God, and God himself brings forth a child through them.
Thus God creates children from the stones, for the seed comes
from the stones.”<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c008'><sup>[757]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>History teaches in manifold examples how the religious
mysteries are liable to change suddenly into sexual orgies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>because they have originated from an overvaluation of the
orgy. It is characteristic that this priapic divinity<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c008'><sup>[758]</sup></a> returns
again to the old symbol of the snake, which in the
mystery enters into the faithful, fertilizing and spiritualizing
them, although it originally possessed a phallic significance.
In the mysteries of the Ophites, the festival
was really celebrated with serpents, in which the animals
were even kissed. (Compare the caressing of the snake
of Demeter in the Eleusinian mysteries.) In the sexual
orgies of the modern Christian sects the phallic kiss plays
a very important rôle. Unternährer was an uncultivated,
crazy peasant, and it is unlikely that the Ophitic religious
ceremonies were known to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The phallic significance is expressed negatively or mysteriously
through the serpent, which always points to a
secret related thought. This related thought connects
with the mother; thus, in a dream a patient found the
following imagery: “A serpent shot out from a moist
cave and bit the dreamer in the region of the genitals.”
This dream took place at the instant when the patient
was convinced of the truth of the analysis, and began
to free himself from the bond of his mother complex.
The meaning is: I am convinced that I am inspired and
poisoned by the mother. The contrary manner of expression
is characteristic of the dream. At the moment
when he felt the impulse to go forwards he perceived the
attachment to the mother. Another patient had the following
dream during a relapse, in which the libido was
again wholly introverted for a time: “She was entirely
filled within by a great snake; only one end of the tail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>peeped out from her arm. She wanted to seize it, but it
escaped her.” A patient with a very strong introversion
(catatonic state) complained to me that a snake was
stuck in her throat.<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c008'><sup>[759]</sup></a> This symbolism is also used by
Nietzsche in the “vision” of the shepherd and the
snake:<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c008'><sup>[760]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“And verily, what I saw was like nothing I ever saw before.
I saw a young shepherd, writhing, choking, twitching with a convulsed
face, from whose mouth hung a black, heavy serpent.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Did I ever see so much disgust and pallid fear upon a countenance?<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c008'><sup>[761]</sup></a>
Might he have been sleeping, and the snake crept
into his mouth—there it bit him fast?</p>

<p class='c017'>“My hand tore at the serpent and tore—in vain!—I failed to
tear the serpent out of his mouth. Then there cried out of me:
‘Bite! Bite! Its head off! Bite!’ I exclaimed; all my horror,
my hate, my disgust, my compassion, all the good and bad cried
out from me in one voice.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Ye intrepid ones around me! solve for me the riddle which I
saw, make clear to me the vision of the lonesomest one.</p>

<p class='c017'>“For it was a vision and a prophecy; what did then I behold
in parable? And who is it who is still to come?</p>

<p class='c017'>“Who is the shepherd into whose mouth crept the snake? Who
is the man into whose throat all the heaviness and the blackest
would creep?<a id='r762' /><a href='#f762' class='c008'><sup>[762]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“But the shepherd bit, as my cry had told him; he bit with a
huge bite! Far away did he spit the head of the serpent—and
sprang up.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No longer shepherd, no longer man, a transfigured being, an
illuminated being, who laughed! Never yet on earth did a man
laugh as he laughed!</p>

<p class='c017'>“O my brethren, I heard a laugh which was no human
laughter—and now a thirst consumeth me, a longing that is never
allayed.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My longing for this laugh eats into me. Oh, how can I
suffer still to live! And how now can I bear to die!”<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c008'><sup>[763]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>The snake represents the introverting libido. Through
introversion one is fertilized, inspired, regenerated and
reborn from the God. In Hindoo philosophy this idea of
creative, intellectual activity has even cosmogenic significance.
The unknown original creator of all things is, according
to Rigveda 10, 121, Prajâpati, the “Lord of
Creation.” In the various Brahmas, his cosmogenic
activity was depicted in the following manner</p>

<p class='c017'>“Prajâpati desired: ‘I will procreate myself, I will be manifold.’
He performed Tapas; after he had performed Tapas he created
these worlds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The strange conception of Tapas is to be translated,
according to Deussen,<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c008'><sup>[764]</sup></a> as “he heated himself with his
own heat,<a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c008'><sup>[765]</sup></a> with the sense of ‘he brooded, he hatched.’”
Here the hatcher and the hatched are not two, but one
and the same identical being. As Hiranyagarbha,
Prajâpati is the egg produced from himself, the world-egg,
from which he hatches himself. He creeps into himself,
he becomes his own uterus, becomes pregnant with
himself, in order to give birth to the world of multiplicity.
Thus Prajâpati through the way of introversion
changed into something new, the multiplicity of the world.
It is of especial interest to note how the most remote
things come into contact. Deussen observes:</p>

<p class='c017'>“In the degree that the conception of Tapas (heat) becomes in
hot India the symbol of exertion and distress, the ‘tapo atapyata’
began to assume the meaning of self-castigation and became related
to the idea that creation is an act of <em>self-renunciation</em> on the part
of the Creator.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>Self-incubation and self-castigation and introversion
are very closely connected ideas.<a id='r766' /><a href='#f766' class='c008'><sup>[766]</sup></a> The Zosimos vision
mentioned above betrays the same train of thought, where
it is said of the place of transformation: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ τόπος τῆς
ἀσκήσεως</span>.<a id='r767' /><a href='#f767' class='c008'><sup>[767]</sup></a> We have already observed that the place
of transformation is really the uterus. Absorption in
one’s self (introversion) is an entrance into one’s own
uterus, and also at the same time asceticism. In the
philosophy of the Brahmans the world arose from this
activity; among the post-Christian Gnostics it produced
the revival and spiritual rebirth of the individual, who
was born into a new spiritual world. The Hindoo philosophy
is considerably more daring and logical, and assumes
that creation results from introversion in general, as in
the wonderful hymn of Rigveda, 10, 29, it is said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What was hidden in the shell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was born through the power of fiery torments.</div>
      <div class='line'>From this first arose love,</div>
      <div class='line'>As the germ of knowledge,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wise found the roots of existence in non-existence,</div>
      <div class='line'>By investigating the hearts impulses.”<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c008'><sup>[768]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This philosophical view interprets the world as an
emanation of the libido, and this must be widely accepted
from the theoretic as well as the psychologic standpoint,
for the function of reality is an instinctive function, having
the character of biological adaptation. When the insane
Schreber brought about the end of the world through
his libido-introversion, he expressed an entirely rational
psychologic view, just as Schopenhauer wished to abolish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>through negation (holiness, asceticism) the error of the
primal will, through which the world was created. Does
not Goethe say:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You follow a false trail;</div>
      <div class='line'>Do not think that we are not serious;</div>
      <div class='line'>Is not the kernel of nature</div>
      <div class='line'>In the hearts of men?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The hero, who is to accomplish the rejuvenation of
the world and the conquest of death, is the libido, which,
brooding upon itself in introversion, coiling as a snake
around its own egg, apparently threatens life with a poisonous
bite, in order to lead it to death, and from that
darkness, conquering itself, gives birth to itself again.
Nietzsche knows this conception:<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c008'><sup>[769]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How long have you sat already upon your misfortune.</div>
      <div class='line'>Give heed! lest you hatch an egg,</div>
      <div class='line'>A basilisk egg</div>
      <div class='line'>Of your long travail.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The hero is himself a serpent, himself a sacrificer and
a sacrificed. The hero himself is of <em>serpent nature</em>;
therefore, Christ compares himself with the serpent;
therefore, the redeeming principle of the world of that
Gnostic sect which styled itself the Ophite was the serpent.
The serpent is the Agatho and Kako demon. It
is, indeed, intelligible, when, in the Germanic saga, they
say that the heroes had serpents’ eyes.<a id='r770' /><a href='#f770' class='c008'><sup>[770]</sup></a> I recall the
parallel previously drawn between the eyes of the Son of
man and those of the Tarpeian dragon. In the already
mentioned mediæval pictures, the dragon, instead of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>Lord, appeared in the cup; the dragon who with changeful,
serpent glances<a id='r771' /><a href='#f771' class='c008'><sup>[771]</sup></a> guarded the divine mystery of renewed
rebirth in the maternal womb. In Nietzsche the old, apparently
long extinct idea is again revived:<a id='r772' /><a href='#f772' class='c008'><sup>[772]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In this poem nearly all the symbolism is collected which
we have elaborated previously from other connections.
Distinct traces of the primitive identity of serpent and
hero are still extant in the myth of Cecrops. Cecrops
is himself half-snake, half-man. Originally, he probably
was the Athenian snake of the citadel itself. As a buried
god, he is like Erechtheus, a chthonic snake god. Above
his subterranean dwelling rises the Parthenon, the temple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>of the virgin goddess (compare the analogous idea of the
Christian church). The casting of the skin of the god,
which we have already mentioned in passing, stands in
the closest relation to the nature of the hero. We have
spoken already of the Mexican god who casts his skin.
It is also told of Mani, the founder of the Manichaean
sect, that he was killed, skinned, stuffed and hung up.<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c008'><sup>[775]</sup></a>
That is the death of Christ, merely in another mythological
form.<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c008'><sup>[776]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Marsyas, who seems to be a substitute for Attis, the
son-lover of Cybele, was also skinned.<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c008'><sup>[777]</sup></a> Whenever a
Scythian king died, slaves and horses were slaughtered,
skinned and stuffed, and then set up again.<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c008'><sup>[778]</sup></a> In Phrygia,
the representatives of the father-god were killed and
skinned. The same was done in Athens with an ox, who
was skinned and stuffed and again hitched to the plough.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this manner the revival of the fertility of the earth
was celebrated.<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c008'><sup>[779]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This readily explains the fragment from the Sabazios
mysteries, transmitted to us by Firmicus:<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c008'><sup>[780]</sup></a> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ταῦρος δράκοντος
καὶ πατὴρ ταύρου δράκων</span><a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c008'><sup>[781]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The active fructifying (upward striving) form of the
libido is changed into the negative force striving downwards
towards death. The hero as zodion of spring
(ram, bull) conquers the depths of winter; and beyond
the summer solstice is attacked by the unconscious longing
for death, and is bitten by the snake. However, he
himself is the snake. But he is at war with himself, and,
therefore, the descent and the end appear to him as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>malicious inventions of the mother of death, who in this
way wishes to draw him to herself. The mysteries, however,
consolingly promise that there is no contradiction<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c008'><sup>[782]</sup></a>
or disharmony when life is changed into death: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταῦρος

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The serpent symbolism of the Last Supper is explained
by the identification of the hero with the serpent: The
god is buried in the mother: as fruit of the field, as food
coming from the mother and at the same time as drink
of immortality he is received by the mystic, or as a serpent
he unites with the mystic. All these symbols represent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>the liberation of the libido from the incestuous
fixation through which new life is attained. The liberation
is accomplished under symbols, which represent the
activity of the incest wish.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might be justifiable at this place to cast a glance
upon psychoanalysis as a method of treatment. In practical
analysis it is important, first of all, to discover the
libido lost from the control of consciousness. (It often
happens to the libido as with the fish of Moses in the
Mohammedan legend; it sometimes “takes its course in
a marvellous manner into the sea.”) Freud says in his
important article, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zur Dynamik der Übertragung</span>”:<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c008'><sup>[784]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“The libido has retreated into regression and again revives the
infantile images.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This means, mythologically, that the sun is devoured
by the serpent of the night, the treasure is concealed and
guarded by the dragon: substitution of a present mode
of adaptation by an infantile mode, which is represented
by the corresponding neurotic symptoms. Freud continues:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thither the analytic treatment follows it and endeavors to
seek out the libido again, to render it accessible to consciousness,
and finally to make it serviceable to reality. Whenever the
analytic investigation touches upon the libido, withdrawn into its
hiding-place, a struggle must break out; all the forces, which have
caused the regression of the libido, will rise up as resistance against
the work, in order to preserve this new condition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mythologically this means: the hero seeks the lost sun,
the fire, the virgin sacrifice, or the treasure, and fights the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>typical fight with the dragon, with the libido in resistance.
As these parallels show, psychoanalysis mobiles a part of
the life processes, the fundamental importance of which
properly illustrates the significance of this process.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Siegfried has slain the dragon, he meets the
father, Wotan, plagued by gloomy cares, for the primitive
mother, Erda, has placed in his path the snake, in
order to enfeeble his sun. He says to Erda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>With fear of shameful ruin and downfall.</div>
      <div class='line'>Filled was his spirit by tidings</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is the same primitive motive which we meet
Wagner: the mother has robbed her son, the sun-god, of
the joy of life, through a poisonous thorn, and deprives
him of his power, which is connected with the name. Isis
demands the name of the god; Erda says, “Thou art not
what thou hast said.” But the “Wanderer” has found
the way to conquer the fatal charm of the mother, the
fear of death:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The eternals’ downfall</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These wise words contain, in fact, the saving thought.
It is not the mother who has placed the poisonous worm
in our path, but our libido itself wills to complete the
course of the sun to mount from morn to noon, and, passing
beyond noon, to hasten towards evening, not at war
with itself, but willing the descent and the end.<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c008'><sup>[785]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Nietzsche’s Zarathustra teaches:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I praise thee, my death, the free death, which comes to me because

<p class='c017'>“And when shall I want it?</p>

<p class='c017'>“He who has a goal and an heir wants death at the proper

<p class='c017'>“And this is the great noonday, when man in the middle of

is a transition: and the sun of his knowledge will be at high noon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Siegfried conquers the father Wotan and takes possession
of Brunhilde. The first object that he sees is her
horse; then he believes that he beholds a mail-clad man.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The pre-existence of the hero and the pre-existence of
Brunhilde as his wife-mother are clearly indicated from
this passage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Siegfried says in confirmation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then death took not my mother?</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>The mother-imago, which is the symbol of the dying
and resurrected libido, is explained by Brunhilde to the
hero, as his own will:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thyself am I</div>
      <div class='line'>If blest I be in thy love.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The great mystery of the Logos entering into the
mother for rebirth is proclaimed with the following words
by Brunhilde:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O Siegfried, Siegfried,</div>
      <div class='line'>Conquering light!</div>

      <div class='line'>Oh, should you guess it?</div>
      <div class='line'>Was only my love for thee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The erotic similes which now follow distinctly reveal
the motive of rebirth:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Siegfried</em>:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“A glorious flood</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Engulf me in bliss.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The motive of plunging into the maternal water of rebirth
(baptism) is here fully developed. An allusion to
the “terrible mother” imago, the mother of heroes, who
teaches them fear, is to be found in Brunhilde’s words
(the horse-woman, who guides the dead to the other
side):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fearest thou, Siegfried?</div>
      <div class='line'>Fearest thou not</div>
      <div class='line'>The wild, furious woman?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The orgiastic “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Occide moriturus</span>” resounds in Brunhilde’s
words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Laughing let us be lost—</div>
      <div class='line'>Laughing go down to death!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And in the words</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Light-giving love,</div>
      <div class='line'>Laughing death!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>is to be found the same significant contrast.</p>

<p class='c007'>The further destinies of Siegfried are those of the Invictus:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>the spear of the gloomy, one-eyed Hagen strikes
Siegfried’s vulnerable spot. The old sun, who has become
the god of death, the one-eyed Wotan, smites his offspring,
and once again ascends in eternal rejuvenation.
The course of the invincible sun has supplied the mystery
of human life with beautiful and imperishable symbols; it
became a comforting fulfilment of all the yearning for
immortality, of all desire of mortals for eternal life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man leaves the mother, the source of libido, and is
driven by the eternal thirst to find her again, and to drink
renewal from her; thus he completes his cycle, and returns
again into the mother’s womb. Every obstacle
which obstructs his life’s path, and threatens his ascent,
wears the shadowy features of the “terrible mother,”
who paralyzes his energy with the consuming poison of
the stealthy, retrospective longing. In each conquest he
wins again the smiling love and life-giving mother—images
which belong to the intuitive depths of human feeling,
the features of which have become mutilated and
irrecognizable through the progressive development of
the surface of the human mind. The stern necessity of
adaptation works ceaselessly to obliterate the last traces
of these primitive landmarks of the period of the origin
of the human mind, and to replace them along lines
which are to denote more and more clearly the nature of
real objects.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE SACRIFICE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After this long digression, let us return to Miss Miller’s
vision. We can now answer the question as to
the significance of Siegfried’s longing for Brunhilde. It
is the striving of the libido away <em>from the mother
towards the mother</em>. This paradoxical sentence may be
translated as follows: as long as the libido is satisfied
merely with phantasies, it moves in itself, in its own
depths, in the mother.<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c008'><sup>[789]</sup></a> When the longing of our author
rises in order to escape the magic circle of the incestuous
and, therefore, pernicious, object, and it does not succeed
in finding reality, then the object is and remains irrevocably
the mother. Only the overcoming of the obstacles
of reality brings the deliverance from the mother, who is
the continuous and inexhaustible source of life for the
creator, but death for the cowardly, timid and sluggish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whoever is acquainted with psychoanalysis knows how
often neurotics cry out against their parents. To be sure,
such complaints and reproaches are often justified on account
of the common human imperfections, but still more
often they are reproaches which should really be directed
towards themselves. Reproach and hatred are always
futile attempts to free one’s self apparently from the parents,
but in reality from one’s own hindering longing for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>the parents. Our author proclaims through the mouth
of her infantile hero Chiwantopel a series of insults
against her own family. We can assume that she must
renounce all these tendencies, because they contain an unrecognized
wish. This hero, of many words, who performs
few deeds and indulges in futile yearnings, is the
libido which has not fulfilled its destiny, but which turns
round and round in the kingdom of the mother, and, in
spite of all its longing, accomplishes nothing. Only he
can break this magic circle who possesses the courage of
the will to live and the heroism to carry it through.
Could this yearning hero-youth, Chiwantopel, but put an
end to his existence, he would probably rise again in the
form of a brave man seeking real life. This necessity
imposes itself upon the dreamer as a wise counsel and
hint of the unconscious in the following monologue of
Chiwantopel. He cries sadly:</p>

<p class='c017'>“In all the world, there is not a single one! I have sought
among a hundred tribes. I have watched a hundred moons, since
I began. Can it be that there is not a solitary being who will
ever know my soul? Yes, by the sovereign God, yes! But ten
thousand moons will wax and wane before that pure soul is born.
And it is from another world that her parents will come to this
one. She will have pale skin and pale locks. She will know sorrow
before her mother bears her. Suffering will accompany her;
she will seek also, and she will find, no one who understands her.
Temptation will often assail her soul—but she will not yield.
In her dreams, I will come to her, and she will understand. <em>I have
kept my body inviolate.</em> I have come ten thousand moons before
her epoch, and she will come ten thousand moons too late. But
she will understand! There is only once in all the ten thousand
moons that a soul like hers is born.”</p>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>Thereupon a green <em>serpent darts from the bushes,
glides towards him and stings him on the arm, then attacks
the horse, which succumbs first</em>. Then Chiwantopel
says to his horse:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Adieu, faithful brother! Enter into rest! I have loved you,
and you have served me well. Adieu. Soon I will rejoin you!’
Then to the snake: ‘Thanks, little sister, you have <em>put an end to
my wanderings</em>.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he cried with grief and spoke his prayer:</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Sovereign God, take me soon! I have tried to know thee,
and to keep thy law! O, do not suffer my body to fall into corruption
and decay, and to furnish the vultures with food!’ A
smoking crater is perceived at a distance, the rumbling of an
earthquake is heard, followed by a trembling of the ground.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Chiwantopel cries in the delirium of suffering, while
the earth covers his body:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have kept my body inviolate. Ah! She understands. Ja-ni-wa-ma,
Ja-ni-wa-ma, thou who comprehendeth me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Chiwantopel’s prophecy is a repetition of Longfellow’s
“Hiawatha,” where the poet could not escape sentimentality,
and at the close of the career of the hero, Hiawatha,
he brings in the Savior of the white people, in the
guise of the arriving illustrious representatives of the
Christian religion and morals. (One thinks of the work
of redemption of the Spaniards in Mexico and Peru!)
With this prophecy of Chiwantopel, the personality of the
author is again placed in the closest relation to the hero,
and, indeed, as the real object of Chiwantopel’s longing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>Most certainly the hero would have married her, had she
lived at his time; but, unfortunately, she comes too late.
The connection proves our previous assertion that the
libido moves round in a circle. The author loves herself;
that is to say, she, as the hero, is sought by one who comes
too late. This motive of coming too late is characteristic
of the infantile love: the father and the mother cannot
be overtaken. The separation of the two personalities
by ten thousand moons is a wish fulfilment; with that
the incest relation is annulled in an effectual manner.
This white heroine will seek without being understood.
(She is not understood, because she cannot understand
herself rightly.) And she will not find. But in dreams,
at least, they will find each other, “and she will understand.”
The next sentence of the text reads:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have kept my body inviolate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This proud sentence, which naturally only a woman can
express, because man is not accustomed to boast in that
direction, again confirms the fact that all enterprises have
remained but dreams, that the body has remained “inviolate.”
When the hero visits the heroine in a dream, it is
clear what is meant. This assertion of the hero’s, that he
has remained inviolate, refers back to the unsuccessful
attempt upon his life in the previous chapter (huntsman
with the arrow), and clearly explains to us what was
really meant by this assault; that is to say, the refusal
of the coitus phantasy. Here the wish of the unconscious
obtrudes itself again, after the hero had repressed it the
first time, and thereupon he painfully and hysterically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>utters this monologue. “Temptation will often assail
her soul—but it will not yield.” This very bold assertion
reduces—noblesse oblige—the unconscious to an enormous
infantile megalomania, which is always the case when the
libido is compelled, through similar circumstances, to regressions.
“Only once in all the ten thousand moons is
a soul born like mine!” Here the unconscious ego expands
to an enormous degree, evidently in order to cover
with its boastfulness a large part of the neglected duty
of life. But punishment follows at its heels. Whoever
prides himself too much on having sustained no wound
in the battle of life lays himself open to the suspicion that
his fighting has been with words only, whilst actually he
has remained far away from the firing-line. This spirit is
just the reverse of the pride of those savage women,
who point with satisfaction to the countless scars which
were given them by their men in the sexual fight for
supremacy. In accordance with this, and in logical
continuation of the same, all that follows is expressed in
figurative speech. The orgiastic “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Occide moriturus</span>” in
its admixture with the reckless laughter of the Dionysian
frenzy confronts us here in sorry disguise with a sentimental
stage trickery worthy of our posthumous edition
of “Christian morals.” In place of the positive phallus,
the negative appears, and leads the hero’s horse (his
libido animalis), not to satisfaction, but into eternal
peace—also the fate of the hero. This end means that
the mother, represented as the jaws of death, devours the
libido of the daughter. Therefore, instead of life and
procreative growth, only phantastic self-oblivion results.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>This weak and inglorious end has no elevating or illuminating
meaning so long as we consider it merely as the solution
of an individual erotic conflict. The fact that the
symbols under which the solution takes place have actually
a significant aspect, reveals to us that behind the individual
mask, behind the veil of “individuation,” a primitive idea
stands, the severe and serious features of which take from
us the courage to consider the sexual meaning of the Miller
symbolism as all-sufficient.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not to be forgotten that the <em>sexual phantasies of
the neurotic and the exquisite sexual language of dreams</em>
are regressive phenomena. The sexuality of the unconscious
is not what it seems to be; <em>it is merely a symbol</em>;
it is a thought bright as day, clear as sunlight, a decision,
a step forward to every goal of life—but expressed in the
unreal sexual language of the unconscious, and in the
thought form of an earlier stage; a resurrection, so to
speak, of earlier modes of adaptation. When, therefore,
the unconscious pushes into the foreground the coitus
wish, negatively expressed, it means somewhat as follows:
under similar circumstances primitive man acted in such
and such a manner. The mode of adaptation which to-day
is unconscious for us is carried on by the savage
Negro of the present day, whose undertakings beyond
those of nutrition appertain to sexuality, characterized by
violence and cruelty. Therefore, in view of the archaic
mode of expression of the Miller phantasy, we are justified
in assuming the correctness of our interpretation for
the lowest and nearest plane only. A deeper stratum of
meaning underlies the earlier assertion that the figure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>Chiwantopel has the character of Cassius, who has a lamb
as a companion. Therefore, Chiwantopel is the portion
of the dreamer’s libido bound up with the mother (and,
therefore, masculine); hence he is her infantile personality,
the childishness of character, which as yet is unable
to understand that one must leave father and mother,
when the time is come, in order to serve the destiny of the
entire personality. This is outlined in Nietzsche’s words:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Free dost thou call thyself? Thy dominant thought would
I hear and not that thou hast thrown off a yoke. Art thou one
who had the right to throw off a yoke? There are many who
throw away their last value when they throw away their servitude.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore, when Chiwantopel dies, it means that herein
is a fulfilment of a wish, that this infantile hero, who
cannot leave the mother’s care, may die. And if with that
the bond between mother and daughter is severed, a
great step forward is gained both for inner and outer
freedom. But man wishes to remain a child too long; he
would fain stop the turning of the wheel, which, rolling,
bears along with it the years; man wishes to keep his
childhood and eternal youth, rather than to die and suffer
corruption in the grave. (“O, do not suffer my body to
fall into decay and corruption.”) Nothing brings the
relentless flight of time and the cruel perishability of all
blossoms more painfully to our consciousness than an inactive
and empty life. <em>Idle dreaming is the mother of
the fear of death</em>, the sentimental deploring of what has
been and the vain turning back of the clock. Although
man can forget in the long- (perhaps too long) guarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>feelings of youth, in the dreamy state of stubbornly
held remembrances, that the wheel rolls onward, nevertheless
mercilessly does the gray hair, the relaxation of
the skin and the wrinkles in the face tell us, that whether
or not we expose the body to the destroying powers of
the whole struggle of life, the poison of the stealthily
creeping serpent of time consumes our bodies, which,
alas! we so dearly love. Nor does it help if we cry out
with the melancholy hero Chiwantopel, “I have kept my
body inviolate”; flight from life does not free us from
the law of age and death. The neurotic who seeks to
get rid of the necessities of life wins nothing and lays
upon himself the frightful burden of a premature age
and death, which must appear especially cruel on account
of the total emptiness and meaninglessness of his life. If
the libido is not permitted to follow the progressive life,
which is willing to accept all dangers and all losses, then
it follows the other road, sinking into its own depths,
working down into the old foreboding regarding the immortality
of all life, to the longing for rebirth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hölderlin exemplifies this path in his poetry and his
life. I leave the poet to speak in his song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'><em>To the Rose.</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In the Mother-womb eternal,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sweetest queen of every lea,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still the living and supernal</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nature carries thee and me.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little rose, the storm’s fierce power</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Strips our leaves and alters us;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet the deathless germ will tower</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To new blooms, miraculous.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>The following comments may be made upon the parable
of this poem: The rose is the symbol of the beloved
woman (“Haidenröslein,” heather rose of Goethe).
The rose blooms in the “rose-garden” of the maiden;
therefore, it is also a direct symbol of the libido. When
the poet dreams that he is with the rose in the mother-womb
of nature, then, psychologically, the fact is that his
libido is with the mother. Here is an eternal germination
and renewal. We have come across this motive already
in the Hierosgamos hymn (Iliad XIV): The nuptials
in the blessed West; that is to say, the union in and with
the mother. Plutarch shows us this motive in naïve form
in his tradition of the Osiris myth; Osiris and Isis copulating
in the mother’s womb. This is also perceived by
Hölderlin as the enviable prerogative of the gods—to
enjoy everlasting infancy. Thus, in Hyperion, he says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fateless, like the sleeping nursling,</div>
      <div class='line'>Breathe the Heavenly ones;</div>
      <div class='line'>Chastely guarded in modest buds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their spirits blossom eternally,</div>
      <div class='line'>And their quiet eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Gaze out in placid</div>
      <div class='line'>Eternal serenity.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This quotation shows the meaning of heavenly bliss.
Hölderlin never was able to forget this first and greatest
happiness, the dreamy picture of which estranged him
from real life. Moreover, in this poem, the ancient
<em>motive of the twins</em> in the mother’s womb is intimated.
(Isis and Osiris in the mother’s womb.) The motive is
archaic. There is a legend in Frobenius of how the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>serpent (appearing from the little serpent in the hollow
tree, through the so-called stretching out of the serpent)
has finally devoured all men (devouring mother—death),
and only a pregnant woman remains alive; she digs a
ditch, covers it with a stone (grave—mother’s womb),
and, living there, she gives birth to twins, the subsequent
dragon-killers (the hero in double form, man and phallus,
man and woman, man with his libido, the dying and rising
sun).</p>

<p class='c007'>This existence together in the mother is to be found
also very beautifully expressed in an African myth (Frobenius):</p>

<p class='c017'>“In the beginning, Obatala, the heaven, and Odudua, the earth,
his wife, lay pressed firmly together in a calabas.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The guarding “in a modest bud” is an idea which has
appeared already in Plutarch, where it is said that the
sun was born in the morning from a flower bud. Brahma,
too, comes from the bud, which also gave birth in Assam
to the first human pair.</p>

<p class='c007'>This poem betrays to us the beginning of the discord
between the poet and nature; he begins to be estranged
from reality, the natural actual existence. It is a remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>idea how the little child chooses “the vine for
his nurse.” This Dionysian allusion is very old. In the
significant blessing of Jacob it is said of Judah (Genesis,
chap. xlix, verse 11):</p>

<p class='c017'>“Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the
choice vine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A Gnostic gem has been preserved upon which there
is a representation of an ass suckling her foal, above
which is the symbol of Cancer, and the circumscription
D.N.I.H.Y.X.P.S.: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus Noster Jesus Christus</span>, with
the supplement <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dei filius</span>. As Justinus Martyr indignantly
observes, the connections of the Christian legend with that
of Dionysus are unmistakable. (Compare, for example,
the miracle of the wine.) In the last-named legend the
ass plays an important rôle. Generally speaking, the ass
has an entirely different meaning in the Mediterranean
countries than with us—an economic one. Therefore, it
is a benediction when Jacob says (Genesis, chap. xlix,
verse 14):</p>

<p class='c017'>“Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The above-mentioned thought is altogether Oriental.
Just as in Egypt the new-born sun is a bull-calf, in the
rest of the Orient it can easily be an ass’s foal, to whom
the vine is the nurse. Hence the picture in the blessing
of Jacob, where it is said of Judah:</p>

<p class='c017'>“His eyes are ruddy with wine and his teeth white with milk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The mock crucifix of the Palatine, with an ass’s head,
evidently alludes to a very significant background.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These poems describe more plainly than could be depicted
with meagre words the persistent arrest and the
constantly growing estrangement from life, the gradual
deep immersion into the maternal abyss of the individual
being. The apocalyptic song of Patmos is strangely related
to these songs of retrogressive longing. It enters
as a dismal guest surrounded by the mist of the depths,
the gathering clouds of insanity, bred through the mother.
In it the primitive thoughts of the myth, the suggestion
clad in symbols, of the sun-like death and resurrection of
life, again burst forth. Similar things are to be found in
abundance among sick people of this sort.</p>

<p class='c007'>I reproduce some significant fragments from Patmos:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Near is the God</div>
      <div class='line'>And hard to comprehend,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>But where Danger threatens</div>
      <div class='line'>The Rescuer appears.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These words mean that the libido has now sunk to the
lowest depths, where “the danger is great.” (Faust,
Part II, Mother scene.) There “the God is near”;
there man may find the inner sun, his own nature, sun-like
and self-renewing, hidden in the mother-womb like
the sun in the nighttime:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... In Chasms</div>
      <div class='line'>And in darkness dwell</div>
      <div class='line'>The eagles; and fresh and fearlessly</div>
      <div class='line'>The Sons of the Alps pass swiftly over the abyss</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon lightly swinging bridges.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With these words the dark phantastic poem passes on.
The eagle, the bird of the sun, dwells in darkness—the
libido has hidden itself, but high above it the inhabitants
of the mountains pass, probably the gods (“Ye are walking
above in the light”), symbols of the sun wandering
across the sky, like the eagle flying over the depths:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... Above and around are reared</div>
      <div class='line'>The summits of Time,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the loved ones, though near,</div>
      <div class='line'>Live on deeply separated mountains.</div>
      <div class='line'>So give us waters of innocence,</div>
      <div class='line'>And give us wings of true understanding,</div>
      <div class='line'>With which to pass across and to return again.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The first is a gloomy picture of the mountains and of
time—although caused by the sun wandering over the
mountains, the following picture a nearness, and at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>same time separation, of the lovers, and seems to hint at
life in the underworld,<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c008'><sup>[796]</sup></a> where he is united with all that
once was dear to him, and yet cannot enjoy the happiness
of reunion, because it is all shadows and unreal and devoid
of life. Here the one who descends drinks the waters of
innocence, the waters of childhood, the drink of rejuvenation,<a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c008'><sup>[797]</sup></a>
so wings may grow, and, winged, he may soar up
again into life, like the winged sun, which arises like a
swan from the water (“Wings, to pass across and to
return again”):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... So I spoke, and lo, a genie</div>
      <div class='line'>Carried me off, swifter than I had imagined,</div>
      <div class='line'>And farther than ever I had thought</div>
      <div class='line'>From my own house!</div>
      <div class='line'>It grew dark</div>
      <div class='line'>As I went in the twilight.</div>
      <div class='line'>The shadowy wood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the yearning brooks of my home-land</div>
      <div class='line'>Grew vague behind me—</div>
      <div class='line'>And I knew the country no longer.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After the dark and obscure words of the introduction,
wherein the poet expresses the prophecy of what is to
come, the sun journey begins (“night journey in the
sea”) towards the east, towards the ascent, towards the
mystery of eternity and rebirth, of which Nietzsche also
dreams, and which he expressed in significant words:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, how could I not be ardent for eternity, and for the nuptial
ring of rings—the ring of the return! Never yet have I
found the woman from whom I wish children, unless she would
be this woman whom I love; for I love thee, O eternity.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>Hölderlin expresses this same longing in a beautiful
symbol, the individual traits of which are already familiar
to us:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... But soon in a fresh radiance</div>
      <div class='line'>Mysteriously</div>
      <div class='line'>Blossoming in golden smoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the rapidly growing steps of the sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Making a thousand summits fragrant,</div>
      <div class='line'>Asia arose!</div>
      <div class='line'>And, dazzled,</div>
      <div class='line'>I sought one whom I knew;</div>
      <div class='line'>For unfamiliar to me were the broad roads,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where from Tmolus</div>
      <div class='line'>Comes the gilded Pactol,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Taurus stands and Messagis—</div>
      <div class='line'>And the gardens are full of flowers.</div>
      <div class='line'>But high up in the light</div>
      <div class='line'>The silvery snow gleams, a silent fire;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as a symbol of eternal life,</div>
      <div class='line'>On the impassable walls,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grows the ancient ivy.<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c008'><sup>[798]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>And carried by columns of living cedars and laurels</div>
      <div class='line'>Are the solemn, divinely built palaces.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The symbol is apocalyptic, the maternal city in the
land of eternal youth, surrounded by the verdure and
flowers of imperishable spring.<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c008'><sup>[799]</sup></a> The poet identifies himself
here with John, who lived on Patmos, who was once
associated with “the sun of the Highest,” and saw him
face to face:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There at the Mystery of the Vine they met,</div>
      <div class='line'>There at the hour of the Holy Feast they gathered,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>The Lord, pouring out his last love, spoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then he died.</div>
      <div class='line'>Much could be said of it—</div>
      <div class='line'>How his triumphant glance,</div>
      <div class='line'>The happiest of all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was seen by his companions, even at the last.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Therefore he sent the Spirit unto them,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the house trembled, solemnly;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, with distant thunder,</div>
      <div class='line'>The storm of God rolled over the cowering heads</div>
      <div class='line'>Where, deep in thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>The heroes of death were assembled....</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, when he, in parting,</div>
      <div class='line'>Appeared once more before them,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then the kingly day, the day of the sun, was put out,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the gleaming sceptre, formed of his rays,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was broken—and suffered like a god itself.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet it shall return and glow again</div>
      <div class='line'>When the right time comes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The fundamental pictures are the sacrificial death and
the resurrection of Christ, like the self-sacrifice of the
sun, which voluntarily breaks its sceptre, the fructifying
rays, in the certain hope of resurrection. The following
comments are to be noted in regard to “the sceptre of
rays”: Spielrein’s patient says, “God pierces through
the earth with his rays.” The earth, in the patient’s mind,
has the meaning of woman. She also comprehends the
sunbeam in mythologic fashion as something solid:
“Jesus Christ has shown me his love, by striking against
the window with a sunbeam.” Among other insane patients
I have come across the same idea of the solid substance
of the sunbeam. Here there is also a hint of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>phallic nature of the instrument which is associated with
the hero. Thor’s hammer, which, cleaving the earth,
penetrates deeply into it, may be compared to the foot of
Kaineus. The hammer is retained in the interior of the
earth, like the treasure, and, in the course of time, it
gradually comes again to the surface (“the treasure
blooms”), meaning that it was born again from the
earth. (Compare what has been said concerning the
etymology of “swelling.”) On many monuments Mithra
holds a peculiar object in his hands, which Cumont compares
to a half-filled tube. Dieterich proves from his
papyrus text that the object is the shoulder of the bull,
the bear constellation. The shoulder has an indirect
phallic meaning, for it is the part which is wanting in
Pelops. Pelops was slaughtered by his father, Tantalus,
dismembered, and boiled in a kettle, to make a meal for
the gods. Demeter had unsuspectingly eaten the shoulder
from this feast, when Zeus discovered the outrage. He
had the pieces thrown back into the kettle, and, with the
help of the life-dispensing Clotho, Pelops was regenerated,
and the shoulder which was missing was replaced
by an ivory one. This substitution is a close parallel to
the substitution of the missing phallus of Osiris. Mithra
is represented in a special ceremony, holding the bull’s
shoulder over Sol, his son and vice-regent. This scene
may be compared to a sort of dedication, or accolade
(something like the ceremony of confirmation). The
blow of the hammer as a generating, fructifying, inspiring
function is retained as a folk-custom and expressed
by striking with the twig of life, which has the significance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>of a charm of fertility. In the neuroses, the sexual meaning
of castigation plays an important part, for among
many children castigation may elicit a sexual orgasm.
The ritual act of striking has the same significance of
generating (fructifying), and is, indeed, merely a variant
of the original phallic ceremonial. Of similar character
to the bull’s shoulder is the cloven hoof of the devil, to
which a sexual meaning also appertains. The ass’s jawbone
wielded by Samson has the same worth. In the
Polynesian Maui myth the jawbone, the weapon of the
hero, is derived from the man-eating woman, Muriranga-whenua,
whose body swells up enormously from
lusting for human flesh (Frobenius). Hercules’ club is
made from the wood of the maternal olive tree. Faust’s
key also “knows the mothers.” The libido springs from
the mother, and with this weapon alone can man overcome
death.</p>

<p class='c007'>It corresponds to the phallic nature of the ass’s jawbone,
that at the place where Samson threw it God caused
a spring to gush forth<a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c008'><sup>[800]</sup></a> (springs from the horse’s tread,
footsteps, horse’s hoof). To this relation of meanings
belongs the magic wand, the sceptre in general.

<p class='c007'>The passage from Asia through Patmos to the Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>mysteries in the poem of Hölderlin is apparently a
superficial connection, but in reality a very ingenious train
of thought; namely, the entrance into death and the land
beyond as a self-sacrifice of the hero, for the attainment
of immortality. At this time, when the sun has set, when
love is apparently dead, man awaits in mysterious joy
the renewal of all life:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... And Joy it was</div>
      <div class='line'>From now on</div>
      <div class='line'>To live in the loving night and see</div>
      <div class='line'>The eyes of innocence hold the unchanging</div>
      <div class='line'>Depths of all wisdom.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Wisdom dwells in the depths, the wisdom of the mother:
being one with it, insight is obtained into the meaning
of deeper things, into all the deposits of primitive times,
the strata of which have been preserved in the soul.
Hölderlin, in his diseased ecstasy, feels once more the
greatness of the things seen, but he does not care to bring
up to the light of day that which he had found in the
depths—in this he differs from Faust.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And it is not an evil, if a few</div>
      <div class='line'>Are lost and never found, and if the speech</div>
      <div class='line'>Conceals the living sound;</div>
      <div class='line'>Because each godly work resembles ours;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet the Highest does not plan it all—</div>
      <div class='line'>The great pit bears two irons,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the glowing lava of Aetna....</div>
      <div class='line'>Would I had the power</div>
      <div class='line'>To build an image and see the Spirit—</div>
      <div class='line'>See it as it was!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>He allows only one hope to glimmer through, formed
in scanty words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He wakes the dead;</div>
      <div class='line'>They who are not enchained and bound,</div>
      <div class='line'>They who are not unwrought.</div>
      <div class='line'>... And if the Heavenly Ones</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, as I believe, love me—</div>
      <div class='line'>... Silent is his sign<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c008'><sup>[802]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>In the dusky sky. And one stands under it</div>
      <div class='line'>His whole life long—for Christ still lives.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But, as once Gilgamesh, bringing back the magic herb
from the west land, was robbed of his treasure by the
demon serpent, so does Hölderlin’s poem die away in a
painful lament, which betrays to us that no victorious resurrection
will follow his descent to the shadows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... Ignominiously</div>
      <div class='line'>A power tears our heart away,</div>
      <div class='line'>For sacrifices the heavenly ones demand.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This recognition, that man must sacrifice the retrogressive
longing (the incestuous libido) before the
“heavenly ones” tear away the sacrifice, and at the same
time the entire libido, came too late to the poet. Therefore,
I take it to be a wise counsel which the unconscious
gives our author, to sacrifice the infantile hero. This
sacrifice is best accomplished, as is shown by the most
obvious meaning, through a complete devotion to life,
in which all the libido unconsciously bound up in familial
bonds, must be brought outside into human contact. For
it is necessary for the well-being of the adult individual,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>who in his childhood was merely an atom revolving in
a rotary system, to become himself the centre of a new
system. That such a step implies the solution or, at least,
the energetic treatment of the individual sexual problem
is obvious, for unless this is done the unemployed libido
will inexorably remain fixed in the incestuous bond, and
will prevent individual freedom in essential matters. Let
us keep in mind that Christ’s teaching separates man from
his family without consideration, and in the talk with
Nicodemus we saw the specific endeavor of Christ to procure
activation of the incest libido. Both tendencies serve
the same goal—the liberation of man; the Jew from his
extraordinary fixation to the family, which does not imply
higher development, but greater weakness and more uncontrolled
incestuous feeling, produced the compensation
of the compulsory ceremonial of the cult and the religious
fear of the incomprehensible Jehovah. When
man, terrified by no laws and no furious fanatics or
prophets, allows his incestuous libido full play, and does
not liberate it for higher purposes, then he is under the
influence of unconscious compulsion. For compulsion is
the unconscious wish. (Freud.) He is under the dominance
of the libido <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἱμαρμένη</span><a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c008'><sup>[803]</sup></a> and his destiny does not
lie in his own hands; his adventures, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τύχαι καὶ Μοῖραι</span>,<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c008'><sup>[804]</sup></a>
fall from the stars. His unconscious incestuous libido,
which thus is applied in its most primitive form, fixes the
man, as regards his love type, in a corresponding primitive
stage, the stage of ungovernableness and surrender
to the emotions. Such was the psychologic situation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>the passing antiquity, and the Redeemer and Physician
of that time was he who endeavored to educate man to
the sublimation of the incestuous libido.<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c008'><sup>[805]</sup></a> The destruction
of slavery was the necessary condition of that sublimation,
for antiquity had not yet recognized the duty
of work and work as a duty, as a social need of fundamental
importance. Slave labor was compulsory work,
the counterpart of the equally disastrous compulsion of
the libido of the privileged. It was only the obligation
of the individual to work which made possible in the
long run that regular “drainage” of the unconscious,
which was inundated by the continual regression of the
libido. Indolence is the beginning of all vice, because
in a condition of slothful dreaming the libido has
abundant opportunity for sinking into itself, in order to
create compulsory obligations by means of regressively reanimated
incestuous bonds. The best liberation is
through <em>regular work</em>.<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c008'><sup>[806]</sup></a> Work, however, is salvation
only when it is a free act, and has in itself nothing
of infantile compulsion. In this respect, religious
ceremony appears in a high degree as organized inactivity,
and at the same time as the forerunner of modern
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller’s vision treats the problem of the sacrifice
of the infantile longing, in the first place, as an individual
problem, but if we cast a glance at the form of
this presentation, then we will become aware that here it
must concern something, which is also a problem of humanity
in general. For the symbols employed, the serpent
which killed the horse<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c008'><sup>[807]</sup></a> and the hero voluntarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>sacrificing himself, are primitive figures of phantasies
and religious myths streaming up from the unconscious.</p>

<p class='c007'>In so far as the world and all within it is, above all,
a thought, which is credited with transcendental “substance”
through the empirical need of the same, there
results from the sacrifice of the regressive libido the creation
of the world; and, psychologically speaking, the world
in general. For him who looks backward the world, and
even the infinite starry sky, is the mother<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c008'><sup>[808]</sup></a> who bends
over and encloses him on all sides, and from the renunciation
of this idea and from the longing for this idea
arises the image of the world. From this most simple
fundamental thought, which perhaps appears strange to
us only because it is conceived according to the <em>principle
of desire and not the principle of reality</em>,<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c008'><sup>[809]</sup></a> results the
significance of the cosmic sacrifice. A good example of
this is the slaying of the Babylonian primitive mother
Tiâmat, the dragon, whose body is destined to form the
heaven and the earth. We come upon this thought in its
most complete form in Hindoo philosophy of the most
ancient date; namely, in songs of Rigveda. In Rigveda
10: 81, 4, the song inquires:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they fashioned out the earth and heaven?</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Viçvakarman, the All-Creator, who created the world
from the unknown tree, did so as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... covered earth on every side and</div>
      <div class='line'>Spread ten fingers’ breadth beyond.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One sees that Purusha is a sort of Platonic world soul,
who surrounds the world from without. Of Purusha it
is said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Being born he overtopped the earth</div>
      <div class='line'>Before, behind, and in all places.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The mother symbolism is plain, it seems to me, in the
idea of Purusha. He represents the mother-imago and
the libido of the child clinging to her. From this assumption
all that follows is very easily explained:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As sacrificial animal on the bed of straw</div>
      <div class='line'>Was dedicated the Purusha,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who was born on the straw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom the Gods, the Blest, and the Wise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Meeting there, sacrificed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This verse is very remarkable; if one wishes to stretch
this mythology out on the procrustean bed of logic, sore
violence would have to be committed. It is an incredibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>phantastic conception that, beside the gods, ordinary
“wise men” unite in sacrificing the primitive being, aside
from the circumstance that, beside the primitive being,
nothing had existed in the beginning (that is to say, before
the sacrifice), as we shall soon see. If the great mystery
of the mother sacrifice is meant thereby, then all becomes
clear:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“From that great general sacrifice</div>

      <div class='line'>And animals both wild and tame.</div>
      <div class='line'>From that great general sacrifice</div>
      <div class='line'>Richas and Sama-hymns were born;</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefrom the metres were produced,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Yajus had its birth from it.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The moon was gendered from his mind</div>
      <div class='line'>And from his eye the Sun had birth;</div>
      <div class='line'>Indra and Agni from his mouth</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Forth from his navel came midair;</div>

      <div class='line'>The regions. Thus they formed the worlds.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that by this is meant not a physical, but a
psychological cosmogony. The world arises when man
discovers it. He discovers it when he sacrifices the
mother; that is to say, when he has freed himself from
the midst of his unconscious lying in the mother. That
which impels him forward to this discovery may be interpreted
psychologically as the so-called “Incest barrier”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>of Freud. The incest prohibition places an end to
the childish longing for the food-giving mother, and compels
the libido, gradually becoming sexual, into the path
of the biological aim. The libido forced away from the
mother by the incest prohibition seeks for the sexual object
in the place of the forbidden mother. In this wider
psychologic sense, which expresses itself in the allegoric
language of the “incest prohibition,” “mother,” etc.,
must be understood Freud’s paradoxical sentence, “Originally
we have known only sexual objects.”<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c008'><sup>[811]</sup></a> This sentence
must be understood psychologically throughout, in
the sense of a world image created from within outwards,
which has, in the first place, nothing to do with
the so-called “objective” idea of the world. This is to
be understood as a new edition of the subjective idea of
the world corrected by reality. Biology, as a science of
objective experience, would have to reject unconditionally
Freud’s proposition, for, as we have made clear
above, the function of reality can only be partly sexual;
in another equally important part it is self-preservation.
The matter appears different for that thought which accompanies
the biological function as an epiphenomenon.
As far as our knowledge reaches, the individual act of
thought is dependent wholly or in greatest part on the
existence of a highly differentiated brain, whereas the
function of reality (adaptation to reality) is something
which occurs in all living nature as wholly independent
from the act of thought. This important proposition of
Freud’s applies only to the act of thought, for thinking,
as we may recognize from manifold traces, arose dynamically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>from the libido, which was split off from the original
object at the “incest barrier” and became actual when
the first budding sexual emotions began to flow in the
current of the libido which goes to the mother. Through
the incest barrier the sexual libido is forced away from the
identification with the parents, and introverted for lack
of adequate activity. It is the sexual libido which forces
the growing individual slowly away from his family. If
this necessity did not exist, then the family would always
remain clustered together in a solid group. Hence the
neurotic always renounces a complete erotic experience,<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c008'><sup>[812]</sup></a>
in order that he may remain a child. Phantasies seem to
arise from the introversion of the sexual libido. Since the
first childish phantasies most certainly do not attain the
quality of a conscious plan, and as phantasies likewise (even
among adults) are almost always the direct derivates of
the unconscious, it is, therefore, highly probable that the
first phantastic manifestations arise from an act of regression.
As we illustrated earlier, the regression goes
back to the presexual stage, as many traces show. Here
the sexual libido obtains again, so to speak, that universal
capacity of application, or capacity for displacement,
which it actually possessed at that stage when the sexual
application was not yet discovered. Naturally, no adequate
object is found in the presexual stage for the regressive
sexual libido, but only surrogates, which always leave
a wish; namely, the wish to have the surrogate as similar
as possible to the sexual goal. This wish is secret, however,
for it is really an incest wish. The unsatisfied unconscious
wish creates innumerable secondary objects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>symbols for the primitive object, the mother (as the
Rigveda says, the creator of the world, “hiding his
origin,” enters into things). From this the thought or
the phantasies proceed, as a desexualized manifestation
of <em>an originally sexual libido</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the standpoint of the libido, the term “incest
barrier” corresponds to one aspect, but the matter, however,
may be considered from another point of view.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time of undeveloped sexuality, about the third
and the fourth year, is, at the same time, considered externally,
the period when the child finds himself confronted
with increased demands from the world of reality. He
can walk, speak and independently attend to a number
of other things. He sees himself in a relation to a
world of unlimited possibilities, but in which he dares
to do little or nothing, because he is as yet too much of
a baby and cannot get on without his mother. At this
time mother should be exchanged for the world. Against
this the past rises as the greatest resistance; this is
always so whenever man would undertake a new adaptation.
In spite of all evidence and against all conscious
resolutions, the unconscious (the past) always enforces
its standpoint as resistance. In this difficult position, precisely
at this period of developing sexuality, we see the
dawning of the mind. The problem of the child at this
period is the discovery of the world and of the great transsubjective
reality. For that he must lose the mother;
every step out into the world means a step away from
the mother. Naturally, all that which is retrogressive in
men rebels against this step, and energetic attempts are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>made against this adaptation in the first place. Therefore,
this period of life is also that in which the first
clearly developed neuroses arise. The tendency of this
age is one directly opposed to that of dementia præcox.
The child seeks to win the world and to leave the mother
(this is a necessary result). The dementia præcox patient,
however, seeks to leave the world and to regain the
subjectivity of childhood. We have seen that in dementia
præcox the recent adaptation to reality is replaced
by an archaic mode of adaptation; that is to say, the
recent idea of the world is rejected in favor of an archaic
idea of the world. When the child renounces his task of
adaptation to reality, or has considerable difficulties in
this direction, then we may expect that the recent adaptation
will again be replaced by archaic modes of adaptation.
It would, therefore, be conceivable that through
regression in children archaic products would naturally
be unearthed; that is to say, old ways of functioning of
the thought system, which is inborn with the brain differentiation,
would be awakened.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to my available but as yet unpublished material,
a remarkably archaic and at the same time generally
applicable character seems to appertain to infantile
phantasy, quite comparable with the products of dementia
præcox. It does not seem improbable that through
regression at this age those same associations of elements
and analogies are reawakened which formerly constituted
the archaic idea of the world. When we now attempt to
investigate the nature of these elements, a glance at the
psychology of myths is sufficient to show us that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>archaic idea was chiefly sexual anthropomorphism. It appears
that these things in the unconscious childish phantasy
play an extraordinary rôle, as we can recognize
from examples taken at random. Just as the sexualism of
neuroses is not to be taken literally but as regressive phantasy
and symbolic compensation for a recent unachieved
adaptation, so is the sexualism of the early infantile
phantasy, especially the incest problem, a regressive
product of the revival of the archaic modes of function,
outweighing actuality. On this account I have expressed
myself very vaguely in this work, I am sure, in regard to
the incest problem. This is done in order not to be responsible
for the idea that I understand by it a gross
sexual inclination towards the parents. The true facts
of the case are much more complicated, as my investigations
point out. Originally incest probably never possessed
particularly great significance as such, because
cohabitation with an old woman for all possible motives
could hardly be preferred to mating with a young woman.
It seems that the mother has acquired incestuous significance
only psychologically. Thus, for example, the
incestuous unions of antiquity were not a result of a love
inclination, but of a special superstition, which is most
intimately bound up with the mythical ideas here treated.
A Pharaoh of the second dynasty is said to have married
his sister, his daughter and his granddaughter; the
Ptolemies were accustomed also to marriage with sisters;
Kambyses married his sister; Artaxerxes married
his two daughters; Qobad I (sixth century A. D.) married
his daughter. The Satrap Sysimithres married his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>mother. These incestuous unions are explained by the
circumstance that in the Zend Avesta the marriage of relatives
was directly commanded;<a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c008'><sup>[813]</sup></a> it emphasized the resemblance
of rulers to the divinity, and, therefore, was
more of an artificial than a natural arrangement, because
it originated more from a theoretical than from a biological
inclination. (A practical impetus towards that lay
often in the peculiar laws of inheritance left over from the
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mutter recht</span></i>, “maternal right” [matriarchal], period.)
The confusion which certainly frequently involved the
barbarians of antiquity in regard to the choice of their
sexual objects cannot very well be measured by the standard
of present-day love psychology. In any case, the
incest of the semi-animal past is in no way proportionate
to the enormous significance of the incest phantasy among
civilized people. This disproportion enforces the assumption
that the incest prohibition which we meet even
amongst relatively lower races concerns rather the mythical
ideas than the biological damage; therefore, the
ethnical prohibition almost always concerns the mother
and seldom the father. Incest prohibition can be understood,
therefore, as a result of regression, and as the
result of a libidinous anxiety, which regressively attacks
the mother. Naturally, it is difficult or impossible to
say from whence this anxiety may have come. I merely
venture to suggest that it may have been a question of a
primitive separation of the pairs of opposites which are
hidden in the will of life: the will for life and for death.
It remains obscure what adaptation the primitive man
tried to evade through introversion and regression to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>parents; but, according to the analogy of the soul life
in general, it may be assumed that the libido, which disturbed
the initial equilibrium of becoming and of ceasing
to be, had been stored up in the attempt to make an
especially difficult adaptation, and from which it recedes
even to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this long digression, let us turn back to the song
of the Rigveda. Thinking and a conception of the world
arose from a shrinking back from stern reality, and
it is only after man has regressively assured himself
again of the protective parental power<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c008'><sup>[814]</sup></a> that he enters
life wrapped in a dream of childhood shrouded in magic
superstitions; that is to say, “thinking,”<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c008'><sup>[815]</sup></a> for he, timidly
sacrificing his best and assuring himself of the favor
of the invisible powers, step by step develops to greater
power, in the degree that he frees himself from his retrogressive
longing and the original lack of harmony in his
being.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rigveda 10, 90, concludes with the exceedingly significant
verse, which is of greatest importance for the
Christian mysteries as well:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Gods, sacrificing, rendered homage to the sacrifice: these were the earliest holy ordinances,</div>
      <div class='line'>The mighty ones attained the height of heaven, there where the Sâdhyas, goddesses of old, are dwelling.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Through the sacrifice a fulness of power was attained,
which extends up to the power of the “parents.” Thus
the sacrifice has also the meaning of a psychologic maturation
process.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>In the same manner that the world originated through
sacrifice, through the renunciation of the retrospective
mother libido, thus, according to the teachings of the
Upanishads, is produced the new condition of man, which
may be termed the immortal. This new condition is
again attained through a sacrifice; namely, through the
sacrificial horse which is given a cosmic significance in the
teaching of the Upanishads. What the sacrificial horse
means is told by Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad 1: 1:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>“<em>Om!</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“1. The dawn is truly the head of the sacrificial horse, the sun
his eye, the wind his breath, his mouth the all-spreading fire, the
year is the body of the sacrificial horse. The sky is his back, the
atmosphere his body cavity, the earth the vault of his belly, the
poles are his sides, the space between the poles his ribs, the seasons
his limbs, the months and half-months his joints, day and night
his feet, the stars his bones, the clouds his flesh, the food, which he
digests, are the deserts; the rivers, his veins; liver and lungs, the
mountains; the herbs and trees, his hair; the rising sun is his forepart,
the setting sun his hind-part. When he shows his teeth, that
is lightning; when he trembles, that is thunder; when he urinates,
that is rain; his voice is speech.</p>

<p class='c017'>“2. The day, in truth, has originated for the horse as the
sacrificial dish, which stands before him; his cradle is in the world-sea
towards the East; the night has originated for him as the sacrificial
dish, which stands behind him; its cradle is in the world-sea
of the evening; these two dishes originated in order to surround
the horse. As a charger he generated the gods, as champion he
produced the Gandharvas, as a racer the demons, as horse mankind.
The Ocean is his relative, the ocean his cradle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Deussen remarks, the sacrificial horse has the significance
of a <em>renunciation of the universe</em>. When the
horse is sacrificed, then the world is sacrificed and destroyed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>as it were—a train of thought which Schopenhauer
also had in mind, and which appears as a product of
a diseased mind in Schreber.<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c008'><sup>[816]</sup></a> The horse in the above
text stands between two sacrificial vessels, from one of
which it comes and to the other of which it goes, just as
the sun passes from morning to evening. The horse,
therefore, signifies the libido, which has passed into the
world. We previously saw that the “mother libido”
must be sacrificed in order to produce the world; here the
world is destroyed by the repeated sacrifice of the same
libido, which once belonged to the mother. The horse
can, therefore, be substituted as a symbol for this libido,
because, as we saw, it had manifold connections with
the mother.<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c008'><sup>[817]</sup></a> The sacrifice of the horse can only
produce another state of introversion, which is similar
to that before the creation of the world. The
position of the horse between the two vessels, which represent
the producing and the devouring mother, hint at
the idea of life enclosed in the ovum; therefore, the vessels
are destined to “surround” the horse. That this
is actually so the Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad 3: 3 proves:</p>

<p class='c017'>“1. From where have the descendants of Parikshit come, that
I ask thee, Yâjñavalkya! From where came the descendants of
Parikshit?</p>

<p class='c017'>“2. Yâjñavalkya spake: ‘He has told thee, they have come
from where all come, who offer up the sacrificial horse. That is
to say, this world extends so far as two and thirty days of the
chariot of the Gods (the sun) reach. This (world) surrounds
the earth twice around. This earth surrounds the ocean twice
around. There is, as broad as the edge of a razor or as the wing
of a fly, a space between (the two shells of the egg of the world).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>These were brought by Indra as a falcon to the wind: and the
wind took them up into itself and carried them where were the
offerers of the sacrificial horse. Somewhat like this he spoke
(Gandharva to thee) and praised the wind.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“Therefore is the wind the special (vyashti) and the wind the
universal (samashti). He, who knows this, defends himself from
dying again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As this text tells us, the offerers of the sacrificial horse
come in that <em>narrowest fissure</em> between the shells of the
egg of the world, at that place, where the shells <em>unite and
where they are divided</em>. The fissure (<em>vagina</em>) in the maternal
world soul is designated by Plato in “Timaeus” by
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Χ</span>, the symbol of the cross. Indra, who as a falcon has
stolen the soma (the treasure attainable with difficulty),
brings, as Psychopompos, the souls to the wind, to the
generating pneuma, which carries them forward to the
fissure or vagina, to the point of union, to the entrance
into the maternal egg. This train of thought of the
Hindoo philosophy briefly and concisely summarizes the
sense of innumerable myths; at the same time it is a
striking example of the fact that philosophy is internally
nothing else but a refined and sublimated mythology. It
is brought to this refined state by the influence of the corrector
of reality.<a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c008'><sup>[818]</sup></a> We have emphasized the fact that
in the Miller drama the horse is the first to die, as the
animal brother of the hero. (Corresponding to the early
death of the half-animal Eabani, the brother friend of
Gilgamesh.) This sacrificial death recalls the whole
category of mythological animal sacrifices. Volumes
could be filled with parallels, but we must limit ourselves
here to suggestions. The sacrificial animal, where it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>lost the primitive meaning of the simple sacrificial gift,
and has taken a higher religious significance, stands in a
close relation to both the hero and the divinity. The
animal represents the god himself;<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c008'><sup>[819]</sup></a> thus the bull<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c008'><sup>[820]</sup></a> represents
Zagreus, Dionysus and Mithra; the lamb represents
Christ,<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c008'><sup>[821]</sup></a> etc. As we are aware, the animal symbols
represent the animal libido. The sacrifice of the animal
means, therefore, the sacrifice of the animal nature. This
is most clearly expressed in the religious legend of Attis.
Attis is the son lover of the divine mother, Agdistis Cybele.
Agdistis was characteristically androgynous,<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c008'><sup>[822]</sup></a> as symbol
of the mother-libido, like the tree; really a clear indication
that the mother-imago has in addition to the significance
of the likeness of the real mother the meaning
of the mother of humanity, the libido in general. Driven
mad by the insanity-breeding mother enamored of him,
he emasculates himself, and that under a pine tree. (The
pine tree plays an important rôle in his service. Every
year a pine tree was wreathed about and upon it an
image of Attis was hung, and then it was cut down, which
represents the castration.) The blood, which spurted to
the earth, was transformed into budding violets. Cybele
now took this pine tree, bore it into her cavern and there
wept over it. (Pietà.) The chthonic mother takes her
son with her into the cavern—namely, into the womb—according
to another version. Attis was transformed into
the pine tree. The tree here has an essentially phallic
meaning; on the contrary, the attaching of the image of
Attis to the tree refers also to the maternal meaning.
(“To be attached to the mother.”) In Ovid (“Metamorphoses,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>Book X) the pine tree is spoken of as
follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Grata deum matri, siquidem Cybeleius Attis</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exuit hac hominem, truncoque induruit illo.</span>”<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c008'><sup>[823]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The transformation into the pine tree is evidently a
burial in the mother, just as Osiris was overgrown by the
heather. Upon the Attis bas-relief of Coblenz Attis appears
<em>growing out of a tree</em>, which is interpreted by
Mannhardt as the “life-principle” of vegetation inherent
in the tree. It is probably a tree birth, just as with
Mithra. (Relief of Heddernheim.) As Firmicus observes,
in the Isis and Osiris cult and also in the cult of
the virgin Persephone, tree and image had played a
rôle.<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c008'><sup>[824]</sup></a> Dionysus had the surname Dendrites, and in
Boeotia he is said to have been called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔνδενδρος</span>,
meaning “in a tree.” (At the birth of Dionysus, Megaira
planted the pine tree on the Kithairon.) The Pentheus
myth bound up with the Dionysus legend furnishes
the remarkable and supplementary counterpart to the
death of Attis, and the subsequent lamentation. Pentheus,<a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c008'><sup>[825]</sup></a>
curious to espy the orgies of the Maenades,
<em>climbed upon a pine tree</em>, but he was observed by his
mother; the Maenades cut down the tree, and Pentheus,
taken for an animal, was torn by them in frenzy,<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c008'><sup>[826]</sup></a> his
own mother being the first to rush upon him. In this
myth the phallic meaning of the tree (cutting down, castration)
and its maternal significance (mounting and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>sacrificial death of the son) is present; at the same time
the supplementary counterpart to the Pietà is apparent,
the “terrible mother.” The feast of Attis was celebrated
as a lamentation and then as a joy in the spring.
(Good Friday and Easter.) The priests of Attis-Cybele
worship were often eunuchs, and were called Galloi.<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c008'><sup>[827]</sup></a>
The archigallus was called Atys (Attis).<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c008'><sup>[828]</sup></a> Instead of
the animal castration, the priests merely scratched their
arms until they bled. (Arm in place of phallus, “the
twisting of arms.”) A similar symbolism of the sacrificial
impulse is met in the Mithraic religion, where essential
parts of the mysteries consist in the catching and
the subduing of the bull.</p>

<p class='c007'>A parallel figure to Mithra is the primitive man Gayomard.
He was created together with his bull, and the
two lived for six thousand years in a blissful state. But
when the world came into the cycle of the seventh sign
of the Zodiac (Libra) the evil principle entered. Libra
is astrologically the so-called positive domicile of Venus;
the evil principle, therefore, came under the dominion
of the goddess of love (destruction of the sun-hero
through the mother-wife—snake, whore, etc). As a result,
after thirty years, Gayomard and his bull died.
(The trials of Zartusht lasted also thirty years; compare
the span of Christ’s life.) Fifty-five species of grain
came from the dead bull, twelve kinds of salubrious
plants, etc. The sperma of the bull entered into the moon
for purification, but the sperma of Gayomard entered
into the sun. This circumstance possibly suggests a rather
feminine meaning of bull. Gosh or Drvâçpa is the soul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>of the bull, and was worshipped as a female divinity. She
would not, at first, from diffidence, become the goddess
of the herds, until the coming of Zarathustra was announced
to her as consolation. This has its parallel in
the Hindoo Purâna, where the coming of Krishna was
promised the earth. (A complete analogy to Christ.<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c008'><sup>[829]</sup></a>)
She, too, travels in her chariot, like Ardvîçûra, the goddess
of love. The soul of the bull is, therefore, decidedly
feminine. This myth of Gayomard repeats only in an
altered form the primitive conception of the closed ring
of a male-female divinity, self-begetting and forth-bringing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like the sacrificial bull, the fire, the sacrifice of which
we have already discussed in Chapter III, has a feminine
nature among the Chinese, according to the commentaries<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c008'><sup>[830]</sup></a>
of the philosopher Tschwang-Tse:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The spirit of the hearth is called Ki. He is clad in bright red,
which resembles fire, and appears as a lovely, attractive maiden.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the “Book of Rites” it is said:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Wood is burned in the flames for the spirit of Au. This
sacrifice to Au is a sacrifice to old departed women.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These spirits of the hearth and fire are the souls of departed
cooks and, therefore, are called “old women.”
The kitchen god develops from this pre-Buddhistic tradition
and becomes later (male sex) the ruler of the
family and the <em>mediator between family and god</em>. Thus
the old feminine fire spirit becomes a species of Logos.
(Compare with this the remarks in Chapter III.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>From the bull’s sperma the progenitors of the cattle
came, as well as two hundred and seventy-two species of
useful animals. According to Mînôkhired, Gayomard
had destroyed the Dév Azûr, who was considered the
demon of evil appetites.<a id='r831' /><a href='#f831' class='c008'><sup>[831]</sup></a> In spite of the efforts of Zarathustra,
this demon remained longest on the earth. He
was destroyed at last at the resurrection, like Satan in the
Apocalypse of John. In another version it is said that
Angromainyus and the serpent were left until the last,
so as to be destroyed by Ahuramazda himself. According
to a surmise by Kern, Zarathustra may mean “golden-star”
and be identical with Mithra. Mithra’s name is
connected with neo-Persian <em>Mihr</em>, which means “sun and
love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Zagreus we see that the bull is also identical with
the god; hence the bull sacrifice is a god sacrifice, but on
a primitive stage. The animal symbol is, so to speak,
only a part of the hero; he sacrifices only his animal;
therefore, symbolically, renounces only his animal nature.
The internal participation in the sacrifice<a id='r832' /><a href='#f832' class='c008'><sup>[832]</sup></a> is expressed
excellently in the anguished ecstatic countenance of the
bull-slaying Mithra. He does it willingly and unwillingly<a id='r833' /><a href='#f833' class='c008'><sup>[833]</sup></a>
hence the somewhat hysterical expression which
has some similarity to the well-known mawkish countenance
of the Crucified of Guido Reni. Benndorf says:<a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c008'><sup>[834]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“The features, which, especially in the upper portion, bear an
absolutely ideal character, have an extremely morbid expression.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cumont<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c008'><sup>[835]</sup></a> himself says of the facial expression of the
Tauroctonos:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>“The countenance, which may be seen in the best reproductions,
is that of a young man of an almost feminine beauty; the
head has a quantity of curly hair, which, rising up from the forehead,
surrounds him as with a halo; the head is slightly tilted
backwards, so that the glance is directed towards the heavens, and
the contraction of the brows and the lips give a strange expression
of sorrow to the face.”<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c008'><sup>[836]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Ostian head of Mithra Tauroctonos, illustrated
in Cumont, has, indeed, an expression which we recognize
in our patients as one of sentimental resignation. <em>Sentimentality
is repressed brutality.</em> Hence the exceedingly
sentimental pose, which had its counterpart in the
symbolism of the shepherd and the lamb of contemporaneous
Christianity, with the addition of infantilism.<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c008'><sup>[837]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, it is only his animal nature which the god
sacrifices; that is to say, his sexuality,<a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c008'><sup>[838]</sup></a> always in close
analogy to the course of the sun. We have learned in
the course of this investigation that the part of the libido
which erects religious structures is in the last analysis
fixed in the mother, and really represents that tie through
which we are permanently connected with our origin.
Briefly, we may designate this amount of libido as
“Mother Libido.” As we have seen, this libido conceals
itself in countless and very heterogeneous symbols, also
in animal images, no matter whether of masculine or feminine
nature—differences of sex are at bottom of a secondary
value and psychologically do not play the part
which might be expected from a superficial observation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The annual sacrifice of the maiden to the dragon probably
represented the most ideal symbolic situation. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>order to pacify the anger of the “terrible mother” the
most beautiful woman was sacrificed as symbol of man’s
libido. Less vivid examples are the sacrifice of the first-born
and various valuable domestic animals. A second
ideal case is the self-castration in the service of the mother
(Dea Syria, etc.), a less obvious form of which is circumcision.
By that at least only a portion is sacrificed.<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c008'><sup>[839]</sup></a>
With these sacrifices, the object of which in ideal cases
is to symbolize the libido drawing away from the mother,
life is symbolically renounced in order to regain it. By
the sacrifice man ransoms himself from the fear of death
and reconciles the destroying mother. In those later religions,
where the hero, who in olden times overcomes all
evil and death through his labors, has become the divine
chief figure, he becomes the priestly sacrificer and the
regenerator of life. But as the hero is an imaginary
figure and his sacrifice is a transcendental mystery, the
significance of which far exceeds the value of an ordinary
sacrificial gift, this deepening of the sacrificial
symbolism regressively resumes the idea of the human
sacrifice. This is partly due to the preponderance of
phantastic additions, which always take their subject-matter
from greater depths, and partly due to the higher
religious occupation of the libido, which demanded a more
complete and equivalent expression. Thus the relation
between Mithra and his bull is very close. It is the hero
himself in the Christian mysteries who sacrifices himself
voluntarily. The hero, as we have sufficiently shown, is
the infantile personality longing for the mother, who as
Mithra sacrifices the wish (the libido), and as Christ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>gives himself to death both willingly and unwillingly.
Upon the monuments of the Mithraic religion we often
meet a strange symbol: a crater (mixing bowl) encoiled
by a serpent, sometimes with a lion, who as antagonist
opposes the serpent.<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c008'><sup>[840]</sup></a> It appears as if the two were
fighting for the crater. The crater symbolizes, as we
have seen, the mother, the serpent the resistance defending
her, and the lion the greatest strength and strongest
will.<a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c008'><sup>[841]</sup></a> The struggle is for the mother. The serpent takes
part almost regularly in the Mithraic sacrifice of the
bull, moving towards the blood flowing from the wound.
It seems to follow from that that the life of the bull
(blood) is sacrificed to the serpent. Previously we have
pointed out the mutual relationship between serpent and
bull, and found there that the bull symbolizes the living
hero, the shining sun, but that the serpent symbolizes the
dead, buried or chthonic hero, the invisible sun. As the
hero is in the mother in the state of death, the serpent
is also, as the symbol of the fear of death, the sign of
the devouring mother. The sacrifice of the bull to the
serpent, therefore, signifies a willing renunciation of life,
in order to win it from death. Therefore, after the sacrifice
of the bull, wonderful fertility results. The antagonism
between serpent and lion over the crater is to
be interpreted as a battle over the fruitful mother’s
womb, somewhat comparable to the more simple symbolism
of the Tishtriya song, where the demon Apaosha,
the black horse, has possession of the rain lake, and the
white horse, Tishtriya, must banish him from it. Death
from time to time lays its destroying hand upon life and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>fertility and the libido disappears, by entering into the
mother, from whose womb it will be born renewed. It,
therefore, seems very probable that the significance of
the Mithraic bull sacrifice is also that of the sacrifice of
the mother who sends the fear of death. As the contrary
of the Occide moriturus is also intended here, so is the
act of sacrifice an impregnating of the mother; the
chthonic snake demon drinks the blood; that is to say, the
libido (sperma) of the hero committing incest. Life is
thus immortalized for the hero because, like the sun, he
generates himself anew. After all the preceding materials,
it can no longer be difficult to recognize in the
Christian mysteries the human sacrifice, or the sacrifice
of the son to the mother.<a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c008'><sup>[842]</sup></a> Just as Attis emasculates
himself on account of the mother, so does Christ himself
hang upon the tree of life,<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c008'><sup>[843]</sup></a> the wood of martyrdom,
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑκάτη</span>,<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c008'><sup>[844]</sup></a> the chthonic mother, and by that redeems
creation from death. By entering again into the mother’s
womb (Matuta, Pietà of Michelangelo) he redeems in
death the sin in life of the primitive man, Adam, in
order symbolically through his deed<a id='r845' /><a href='#f845' class='c008'><sup>[845]</sup></a> to procure for the
innermost and most hidden meaning of the religious
libido its highest satisfaction and most pronounced expression.
The martyrdom of Christ has in Augustine as
well actually the meaning of a Hierosgamos with the
mother (corresponding to the Adonis festival, where
Venus and Adonis were laid upon the nuptial couch):</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Procedit Christus quasi sponsus de thalamo suo, præsagio
nuptiarum exiit ad campum sæculi; pervenit usque ad crucis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>torum (<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">torus has the meaning of bed, pillow, concubine, bier</span>) et
ibi firmavit ascendendo conjugium: ubi cum sentiret anhelantem
in suspiriis creaturam commercio pietatis se pro conjuge dedit ad
pœnam et copulavit sibi perpetuo iure matronam.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>This passage is perfectly clear. A similar death overtakes
the Syrian Melcarth, who, riding upon a sea horse,
was annually burned. Among the Greeks he is called
Melicertes, and was represented riding upon a dolphin.
The dolphin is also the steed of Arion. We have learned
to recognize previously the maternal significance of
dolphin, so that in the death of Melcarth we can once
more recognize the negatively expressed Hierosgamos
with the mother. (Compare Frazer “Golden Bough,”
IV, p. 87.) This figurative expression is of the greatest
teleological significance. Through its symbol it leads
that libido which inclines backward into the original,
primitive and impulsive upwards to the spiritual by investing
it with a mysterious but fruitful function. It is
superfluous to speak of the effect of this symbol upon
the unconscious of Occidental humanity. A glance over
history shows what creative forces were released in this
symbol.<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c008'><sup>[846]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The comparison of the Mithraic and the Christian
sacrifice plainly shows wherein lies the superiority of the
Christian symbol; it is the frank admission that not only
are the lower wishes to be sacrificed, but the whole personality.
The Christian symbol demands complete devotion;
it compels a veritable self-sacrifice to a higher
purpose, while the Sacrificium Mithriacum, remaining
fixed on a primitive symbolic stage, is contented with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>animal sacrifice. The religious effect of these symbols
must be considered as an orientation of the unconscious
by means of imitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Miss Miller’s phantasy there is internal compulsion,
in that she passes from the horse sacrifice to the
self-sacrifice of the hero. Whereas the first symbolizes
renunciation of the sexual wishes, the second has the
deeper and ethically more valuable meaning of the sacrifice
of the infantile personality. The object of psychoanalysis
has frequently been wrongly understood to mean
the renunciation or the gratification of the ordinary sexual
wish, while, in reality, the problem is the sublimation of
the infantile personality, or, expressed mythologically, a
sacrifice and rebirth of the infantile hero.<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c008'><sup>[847]</sup></a> In the Christian
mysteries, however, the resurrected one becomes a
supermundane spirit, and the invisible kingdom of God,
with its mysterious gifts, are obtained by his believers
through the sacrifice of himself on the mother. In
psychoanalysis the infantile personality is deprived of its
libido fixations in a rational manner; the libido which is
thus set free serves for the building up of a personality
matured and adapted to reality, who does willingly and
without complaint everything required by necessity. (It
is, so to speak, the chief endeavor of the infantile personality
to struggle against all necessities and to create coercions
for itself where none exist in reality.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The serpent as an instrument of sacrifice has already
been abundantly illustrated. (Legend of St. Silvester,
trial of the virgins, wounding of Rê and Philoctetes, symbolism
of the lance and arrow.) It is the destroying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>knife; but, according to the principle of the “Occide
moriturus” also the phallus, the sacrificial act represents
a coitus act as well.<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c008'><sup>[848]</sup></a> The religious significance of the
serpent as a cave-dwelling, chthonic animal points to a
further thought; namely, to the creeping into the
mother’s womb in the form of a serpent.<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c008'><sup>[849]</sup></a> As the horse
is the brother, so the serpent is the sister of Chiwantopel.
This close relation refers to a fellowship of these animals
and their characters with the hero. We know of the
horse that, as a rule, he is not an animal of fear, although,
mythologically, he has at times this meaning. He signifies
much more the living, positive part of the libido,
the striving towards continual renewal, whereas the serpent,
as a rule, represents the fear, the fear of death,<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c008'><sup>[850]</sup></a>
and is thought of as the antithesis to the phallus. This
antithesis between horse and serpent, mythologically between
bull and serpent, represents an opposition of the
libido within itself, a striving forwards and a striving
backwards at one and the same time.<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c008'><sup>[851]</sup></a> It is not only
as if the libido might be an irresistible striving forward,
an endless life and will for construction, such as Schopenhauer
has formulated in his world will, death and every
end being some malignancy or fatality coming from without,
but the libido, corresponding to the sun, also wills
the destruction of its creation. In the first half of life
its will is for growth, in the second half of life it hints,
softly at first, and then audibly, at its will for death.
And just as in youth the impulse to unlimited growth often
lies under the enveloping covering of a resistance against
life, so also does the will of the old to die frequently lie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>under the covering of a stubborn resistance against the
end.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_481.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>PRIAPUS AND SERPENT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This apparent contrast in the nature of the libido is
strikingly illustrated by a Priapic statuette in the antique
collection at Verona.<a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c008'><sup>[852]</sup></a> Priapus smilingly points with his
finger to a snake biting off his “membrum.” He carries
a basket on his arm, filled with oblong objects, probably
phalli, evidently prepared as substitutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>A similar motive is found in the “Deluge” of Rubens
(in the Munich Art Gallery), where a serpent emasculates
a man. This motive explains the meaning of the
“Deluge”; the maternal sea is also the devouring
mother.<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c008'><sup>[853]</sup></a> The phantasy of the world conflagration, of
the cataclysmic end of the world in general, is nothing
but a mythological projection of a personal individual
will for death; therefore, Rubens could represent the
essence of the “Deluge” phantasy in the emasculation
by the serpent; for the serpent is our own repressed will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>for the end, for which we find an explanation only with
the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concerning the symbolism of the serpent in general, its
significance is very dependent upon the time of life and
circumstances. The repressed sexuality of youth is symbolized
by the serpent, because the arrival of sexuality
puts an end to childhood. To age, on the contrary, the
serpent signifies the repressed thought of death. With
our author it is the insufficiently expressed sexuality
which as serpent assumes the rôle of sacrificer and delivers
the hero over to death and rebirth.</p>

<p class='c007'>As in the beginning of our investigation the hero’s
name forced us to speak of the symbolism of Popocatepetl
as belonging to the creating part of the human body,
so at the end does the Miller drama again give us an
opportunity of seeing how the volcano assists in the
death of the hero and causes him to disappear by means
of an earthquake into the depths of the earth. As the
volcano gave birth and name to the hero, so at the end of
the day it devours him again.<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c008'><sup>[854]</sup></a> We learn from the last
words of the hero that <em>his longed-for beloved</em>, she who
alone understands him, is called Ja-ni-wa-ma. We find
in this name those lisped syllables familiar to us from
the early childhood of the hero, Hiawatha, Wawa, wama,
mama. The only one who really understands us is the
mother. For <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">verstehen</span></i>, “to understand” (Old High
German <i><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">firstân</span></i>), is probably derived from a primitive
Germanic prefix <em>fri</em>, identical with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περὶ</span>, meaning “roundabout.”
The Old High German <i><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">antfristôn</span></i>, “to interpret,”
is considered as identical with <em>firstân</em>. From that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>results a fundamental significance of the verb <em>verstehen</em>,
“to understand,” as “standing round about something.”<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c008'><sup>[855]</sup></a>
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comprehendere</span></i> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατασυλλαμβάνειν</span> express
a similar idea as the German <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">erfassen</span></i>, “to grasp,
to comprehend.” The thing common to these expressions
is the surrounding, the enfolding. And there is no
doubt that there is nothing in the world which so completely
enfolds us as the mother. When the neurotic
complains that the world has no understanding, he says
indirectly that he misses the mother. Paul Verlaine has
expressed this thought most beautifully in his poem,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Rêve Familier</span>”:</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. It is difficult to calculate how great is the seductive influence of the
primitive word-meaning upon a thought. “Anything which has even been
in consciousness remains as an affective moment in the unconscious,” says
Hermann Paul (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prinzipien der Sprachgeschichte</span>,” 4th ed., 1909, p.
25). The old word-meanings have an after-effect, chiefly imperceptible,
“within the dark chamber of the unconscious in the Soul” (Paul). J. G.
Hamann, mentioned above, expresses himself unequivocably: “Metaphysics
reduces all catchwords and all figures of speech of our empirical
knowledge to empty hieroglyphics and types of ideal relations.” It is
said that Kant learned some things from Hamann.</p>

(<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie</span></cite>, 1908) has made at my

the intra-psychic association is influenced by phonetic considerations
(“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Untersuchungen über den Einfluss der sprachlichen Komponente auf die

<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. So at least this form of thought appears to Consciousness. Freud
says in this connection (“The Interpretation of Dreams,” tr. by Brill,
p. 418): “It is demonstrably incorrect to state that we abandon ourselves
to an aimless course of ideas when we relinquish our reflections, and
allow the unwilled ideas to emerge. It can be shown that we are able
to reject only those end-presentations known to us, and that immediately
upon the cessation of these unknown or, as we inaccurately say, unconscious
end-presentations come into play which now determine the course
of the unwilled ideas—a thought without end-presentation cannot be
produced through any influence we can exert on our own psychic life.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. Behind this assertion stand, first of all, experiences taken from the
field of the normal. The undirected thinking is very far removed from
“meditation,” and especially so as far as readiness of speech is concerned.
In psychological experiments I have frequently found that the
subjects of the investigation—I speak only of cultivated and intelligent
people, whom I have allowed to indulge in reveries, apparently unintentionally
and without previous instruction—have exhibited affect-expressions
which can be registered experimentally. But the basic
thought of these, even with the best of intentions, they could express only
incompletely or even not at all. One meets with an abundance of
similar experiences in association experiments and psychoanalysis—indeed,
there is hardly an unconscious complex which has not at some time
existed as a phantasy in consciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, more instructive are the experiences from the domain of
psychopathology. But those arising in the field of the hysterias and
neuroses, which are characterized by an overwhelming transference
tendency, are rarer than the experiences in the territory of the introversion
type of neuroses and psychoses, which constitute by far the
greater number of the mental derangements, at least the collected
Schizophrenic group of Bleuler. As has already been indicated by the
term “introversion,” which I briefly introduced in my study, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Konflikte
der kindlichen Seele</span>,” pp. 6 and 10, these neuroses lead to an overpowering
autoerotism (Freud). And here we meet with this unutterable
purely phantastic thinking, which moves in inexpressible symbols and
feelings. One gets a slight impression of this when one seeks to examine
the paltry and confused expressions of these people. As I have frequently
observed, it costs these patients endless trouble and effort to put their
phantasies into common human speech. A highly intelligent patient,
who interpreted such a phantasy piece by piece, often said to me, “I
know absolutely with what it is concerned, I see and feel everything,
but it is quite impossible for me to find the words to express it.” The
poetic and religious introversion gives rise to similar experiences; for
example, Paul, in the Epistle to the Romans viii:26—“For we know
not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. <span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>Similarly, James remarks, “The great difference, in fact, between
that simple kind of rational thinking which consists in the concrete
objects of past experience merely suggesting each other, and reason distinctively
so called, is this, that whilst the empirical thinking is only
reproductive, reasoning is productive.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. Compare the impressive description of Petrarch’s ascent of Mt.
Ventoux, by Jacob Burckhardt (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien</span>,”

<p class='c007'>“One now awaits a description of the view, but in vain, not because
the poet is indifferent to it, but, on the contrary, because the impression
affects him all too strongly. His entire past life, with all its follies,
passes before him; he recalls that it is ten years ago to-day that he,
as a young man, left Bologna, and he turns a yearning glance toward
Italy. He opens a book—‘Confessions of St. Augustine,’ his companion
at that time—and his eye falls upon this passage in the tenth chapter:
‘and the people went there and admired the high mountains, the wide
wastes of the sea and the mighty downward rushing streams, and the
ocean and the courses of the stars, and forgot themselves.’ His brother,
to whom he reads these words, cannot comprehend why, at this point, he
closes the book and is silent.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. Wundt gives a striking description of the scholastic method in his
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Philosophische Studien</span>,” XIII, p. 345. The method consists “first in
this, that one realizes the chief aim of scientific investigation is the
discovery of a comprehensive scheme, firmly established, and capable of
being applied in a uniform manner to the most varied problems; secondly,
in that one lays an excessive value upon certain general ideas,
and, consequently, upon the word-symbols designating these ideas,
wherefore an analysis of word-meanings comes, in extreme cases, to be
an empty subtlety and splitting of hairs, instead of an investigation of
the real facts from which the ideas are abstracted.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. <span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>The concluding passage in “Traumdeutung” was of prophetic significance,
and has been brilliantly established since then through investigations
of the psychoses. “In the psychoses these modes of operation
of the psychic mechanism, normally suppressed in the waking state, again
become operative, and then disclose their inability to satisfy our needs
in the outer world.” The importance of this position is emphasized by
the views of Pierre Janet, developed independently of Freud, and which
deserve to be mentioned here, because they add confirmation from an
entirely different side, namely, the biological. Janet makes the distinction
in this function of a firmly organized “inferior” and “superior”
part, conceived of as in a state of continuous transformation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is really on this superior part of the functions, on their adaptation
to present circumstances, that the neuroses depend. The neuroses are
the disturbances or the checks in the evolution of the functions—the
illnesses depending upon the morbid functioning of the organism. These
are characterized by an alteration in the superior part of the functions,
in their evolution and in their adaptation to the present moment—to the
present state of the exterior world and of the individual, and also by the
absence or deterioration of the old parts of these same functions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the place of these superior operations there are developed physical,
mental, and, above all, emotional disturbances. This is only the tendency
to replace the superior operations by an exaggeration of certain inferior
operations, and especially by gross visceral disturbances” (“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
Névroses</span>,” p. 383).</p>

<p class='c007'>The old parts are, indeed, the inferior parts of the functions, and these
replace, in a purposeless fashion, the abortive attempts at adaptation.
Briefly speaking, the archaic replaces the recent function which has
failed. Similar views concerning the nature of neurotic symptoms are
expressed by Claparède as well (“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelques mots sur la définition de
l’Hystérie</span>,” <cite>Arch. de Psychol.</cite>, I, VII, p. 169).</p>

<p class='c007'>He understands the hysterogenic mechanism as a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tendance à la
réversion</span>”—as a sort of atavistic manner of reaction.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r33'>33</a>. I am indebted to Dr. Abraham for the following interesting communication:
“A little girl of three and a half years had been presented
with a little brother, who became the object of the well-known childish
jealousy. Once she said to her mother, ‘You are two mammas; you are
my mamma, and your breast is little brother’s mamma.’ She had just
been looking on with great interest at the process of nursing.” It is very
characteristic of the archaic thinking of the child for the breast to be
designated as “mamma.”</p>

present as impersonal a judgment as Drews. Kalthoff says, “The
sources from which we derive our information concerning the origin of
Christianity are such that in the present state of historical research no
historian would undertake the task of writing the biography of an
historical Jesus.” Ibid., p. 10: “To see behind these stories the life of
a real historical personage, would not occur to any man, if it were not
for the influence of rationalistic theology.” Ibid., p. 9: “The divine
in Christ, always considered an inner attribute and one with the human,
leads in a straight line backward from the scholarly man of God, through
the Epistles and Gospels of the New Testament, to the Apocalypse of
Daniel, in which the theological imprint of the figure of Christ has
arisen. At every single point of this line Christ shows superhuman
traits; nowhere is He that which critical theology wished to make Him,
simply a natural man, an historic individual.”</p>

away for the special interpretation of Faust. You are well provided
with commentaries of all sorts. Hark! let us at once take the whole
foolish pack back to the reading-room from whence they have come.
What you are destined to find in Faust, that you will find by intuition.
Faust is nothing else than pure and legitimate myth, a great primitive
conception, so to speak, in which everyone can divine in his own way
his own nature and destiny. Allow me to make a comparison: What
would the ancient Greeks have said had a commentator interposed himself
between them and the Oedipus legend? There was a chord of the
Oedipus legend in every Greek which longed to be touched directly and
respond in its own way. And thus it is with the German nation and
Faust.”</p>

the author, with a certain unselfish scientific interest, has exposed to
public view. Yet it seemed to me that the writer would possess an
understanding deeper than any objections of my critics. There is always
some risk when one exposes one’s self to the world. The absence of
any personal relation with Miss Miller permits me free speech, and also
exempts me from those considerations due woman which are prejudicial
to conclusions. The person of the author is on that account just as
shadowy to me as are her phantasies; and, like Odysseus, I have tried
to let this phantom drink only enough blood to enable it to speak, and
in so doing betray some of the secrets of the inner life.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have not undertaken this analysis, for which the author owes me but
little thanks, for the pleasure of revealing private and intimate matters,

<p class='c010'><a href='#r57'>57</a>. A very beautiful example of this is found in C. A. Bernoulli: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Franz
Overbeck und Friedrich Nietzsche. Eine Freundschaft</span>,” 1908 (Pt. I,
p. 72). This author depicts Nietzsche’s behavior in Basle society: “Once
at a dinner he said to the young lady at his side, ‘I dreamed a short
time ago that the skin of my hand, which lay before me on the table,
suddenly became like glass, shiny and transparent, through which I saw
distinctly the bones and the tissues and the play of the muscles. All at
once I saw a toad sitting on my hand and at the same time I felt an
irresistible compulsion to swallow the beast. I overcame my terrible
aversion and gulped it down.’ The young lady laughed. ‘And do you
laugh at that?’ Nietzsche asked, his deep eyes fixed on his companion,
half questioning, half sorrowful. The young lady knew intuitively that
she did not wholly understand that an oracle had spoken to her in the
form of an allegory and that Nietzsche had revealed to her a glimpse
into the dark abyss of his inner self.” On page 166 Bernoulli continues
as follows: “One can perhaps see, behind that harmless pleasure
of faultless exactness in dress, a dread of contamination arising from
some mysterious and tormenting disgust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nietzsche went to Basle when he was very young; he was then just
at the age when other young people are contemplating marriage. Seated
next to a young woman, he tells her that something terrible and disgusting
is taking place in his transparent hand, something which he
must take completely into his body. We know what illness caused the
premature ending of Nietzsche’s life. It was precisely this which he
would tell the young lady, and her laughter was indeed discordant.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f61'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r61'>61</a>. This mental disturbance had until recently the very unfortunate
designation, Dementia Praecox, given by Kraepelin. It is extremely unfortunate
that this malady should have been discovered by the psychiatrists,
for its apparently bad prognosis is due to this circumstance.
Dementia praecox is synonymous with therapeutic hopelessness. How
would hysteria appear if judged from the standpoint of psychiatry!
The psychiatrist naturally sees in the institutions only the worst cases
of dementia praecox, and as a consequence of his therapeutic helplessness
he must be a pessimist. How deplorable would tuberculosis appear
if the physician of an asylum for the incurable described the nosology
of this disease! Just as little as the chronic cases of hysteria, which
gradually degenerate in insane asylums, are characteristic of real
hysteria, just so little are the cases of dementia praecox in asylums
characteristic of those early forms so frequent in general practice, and
which Janet has described under the name of Psychasthenia. These
cases fall under Bleuler’s description of Schizophrenia, a name which
connotes a psychological fact, and might easily be compared with
similar facts in hysteria. The term which I use in my private work
for these conditions is Introversion Neurosis, by which, in my opinion,
the most important characteristic of the condition is given, namely, the
predominance of introversion over transference, which latter is the
characteristic feature of hysteria.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my “Psychology of Dementia Praecox” I have not made any study
of the relationship of the Psychasthenia of Janet. Subsequent experience
with Dementia Praecox, and particularly the study of Psychasthenia in
Paris, have demonstrated to me the essential relationship of Janet’s
group with the Introversion Neuroses (the Schizophrenia of Bleuler).</p>

to the expression “Complex,” in order, by the choice of terminology, to
invest this psychological condition, which I include under “Imago,”
with living independence in the psychical hierarchy, that is to say,
with that autonomy which, from a large experience, I have claimed
as the essential peculiarity of the emotional complex. (Compare “The
Psychology of Dementia Praecox.”) My critics, Isserlin especially, have
seen in this view a return to medieval psychology, and they have, therefore,
rejected it utterly. This “return” took place on my part consciously
and intentionally because the phantastic, projected psychology
of ancient and modern superstition, especially demonology, furnishes
exhaustive evidence for this point of view. Particularly interesting
insight and confirmation is given us by the insane Schreber in an autobiography
(“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken</span>,” Mutze, Leipzig),

There is naturally no mention of sound. This <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</span>, which is very
similar to the later conception of Philo, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόγος σπερματικός</span> of the
Gnostics and the Pauline <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πνεῦμα</span> (spirit) as well as to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πνεῦμα</span> of the

significance of the fructifying breath of the winds, which impregnated
the mares of Lusitania, and the Egyptian vultures. The animation of
Adam and the impregnation of the Mother of God by the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πνεῦμα</span> are produced
in a similar manner. The infantile incest phantasy of one of my
patients reads: “the father covered her face with his hands and blew

<p class='c007'><a href='#r77'>77</a>. This time I shall hardly be spared the reproach of mysticism. But
perhaps the facts should be further considered; doubtless the unconscious
contains material which does not rise to the threshold of consciousness.
The analysis dissolves these combinations into their historical determinants,
for it is one of the essential tasks of analysis to render impotent
by dissolution the content of the complexes competing with the proper
conduct of life. Psychoanalysis works backwards like the science of
history. Just as the largest part of the past is so far removed that it is
not reached by history, so too the greater part of the unconscious determinants
is unreachable. History, however, knows nothing of two
kinds of things, that which is hidden in the past and that which is
hidden in the future. Both perhaps might be attained with a certain
probability; the first as a postulate, the second as an historical prognosis.
In so far as to-morrow is already contained in to-day, and all
the threads of the future are in place, so a more profound knowledge
of the past might render possible a more or less far-reaching and certain
knowledge of the future. Let us transfer this reasoning, as Kant has
already done, to psychology. Then necessarily we must come to the
same result. Just as traces of memory long since fallen below the
threshold of consciousness are accessible in the unconscious, so too there
are certain very fine subliminal combinations of the future, which are
of the greatest significance for future happenings in so far as the future
is conditioned by our own psychology. But just so little as the science
of history concerns itself with the combinations for the future, which is
the function of politics, so little, also, are the psychological combinations
for the future the object of analysis; they would be much more the object
of an infinitely refined psychological synthesis, which attempts to follow
the natural current of the libido. This we cannot do, but possibly this
might happen in the unconscious, and it appears as if from time to time,
in certain cases, significant fragments of this process come to light, at
least in dreams. From this comes the prophetic significance of the dream
long claimed by superstition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aversion of the scientific man of to-day to this type of thinking,
hardly to be called phantastic, is merely an overcompensation to the very
ancient and all too great inclination of mankind to believe in prophesies
and superstitions.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r89'>89</a>. <span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>Take as an example among many others the striking psychologic description
of the fate of Alypius, in the “Confessions” of St. Augustine
(Bk. VI, Ch. 7): “Only the moral iniquity of Carthage, expressed in the
absolute wildness of its worthless spectacles, had drawn him down into
the whirlpool of this misery. [Augustine, at that time a teacher of
Logic, through his wisdom had converted Alypius.] He rose up after
those words from the depths of the mire, into which he had willingly
let himself be submerged, and which had blinded him with fatal pleasure.
He stripped the filth from off his soul with courageous abstemiousness.
All the snares of the Hippodrome no longer perplexed him. Thereupon
Alypius went to Rome in order to study law; there he became a backslider.
He was transported to an unbelievable degree by an unfortunate
passion for gladiatorial shows. Although in the beginning he abominated
and cursed these shows, one evening some of his friends and
fellow-students, whom he met after they had dined, in spite of his passionate
refusals and the exertion of all the power of his resistance,
dragged him with friendly violence to the Amphitheatre on the occasion
of a cruel and murderous exhibition. At the time he said to them, ‘If
you drag my body to that place and hold it there, can you turn my
mind and my eyes to that spectacle?’ In spite of his supplications they
dragged him with them, eager to know if he would be able to resist the
spectacle. When they arrived they sat down where place was still left,
and all glowed with inhuman delight. He closed his eyes and forbade
his soul to expose itself to such danger. O, if he had also stopped up
his ears! When some one fell in combat and all the people set up
a mighty shout, he stifled his curiosity and prepared proudly to scorn
the sight, confident that he could view the spectacle if he so desired.
And his soul was overcome with terrible wounds, like the wounds of
the body which he desired to see, and souls more miserable than the one
whose fall had caused the outcry, which pressing through his ears, had
opened his eyes, so that his weakness had been bared. Through this he
could be struck and thrown down, for he had the feeling of confidence
more than strength, and he was the weaker because he trusted himself
to this and not to Thee. When he saw the blood, then at the same
time he drew in the desire for blood, and no longer turned away but
directed his looks thither. The fury took possession of him and yet he
did not know it; he took delight in the wicked combat and was intoxicated
by the bloody pleasure. Now he was no longer the same as when
he had come, and he was the true accomplice of those who first had
dragged him there. What more is there to say? He saw, he cried out,
he was inflamed, and he carried away with him the insane longing,
which enticed him again to return, not only in the company of those who
first had dragged him with them, but going ahead of all and leading
others.”</p>

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f91'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r91'>91</a>. Compare the prayer of the so-called Mithraic Liturgy (pub. by
Dieterich). There, characteristic places are to be found, such for instance
as: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης μου ψυχικῆς δυνάμεως ἤν ἐγὼ πάλιν μεταπαραλήμψομαι
μετὰ τὴν ἐνεστῶσαν καὶ κατεπείγουσάν με πικρὰν ἀνάγκην ἁχρεοκόπητον</span> (The
human soul force which I, weighed down by guilt, would again attain,
because of the present bitter need oppressing me), <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπικαλοῦμαι ἕνεκα τῆς
κατεπειγούσης καὶ πικρᾶς ἀπαραιτήτου ἀνάγκης</span> (On account of the oppressing
bitter and inexorable need).</p>

<p class='c007'>From the speech of the High Priest (Apuleius: “Metamorphoses,”
lib. XI, 248) a similar train of thought may be gathered. The young
philosopher Lucius was changed into an ass, that continuously rutting
animal which Isis hated. Later he was released from the enchantment
and initiated into the mysteries of Isis. When he was freed from the
spell the priest speaks as follows: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lubrico virentis aetatulae, ad serviles
delapsus voluptates, curiositatis improsperae sinistrum praemium reportasti.—Nam
in eos, quorum sibi vitas servitium Deae nostrae majestas
vindicavit, non habet locum casus infestus—in tutelam jam receptus
es Fortunae, sed videntis</span>” (But falling into the slavery of pleasure, in
the wantonness of buxom youth, you have reaped the inauspicious reward
of your ill-fated curiosity—for direful calamity has no power over those
whose lives the majesty of our Goddess has claimed for her own
service.—You are now received under the guardianship of fortune, but
of a fortune who can see). In the prayer to the Queen of Heaven, Isis,
Lucius says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qua fatorum etiam inextricabiliter contorta retractas licia
et Fortunae tempestates mitigas, et stellarum noxios meatus cohibes</span>”
(By which thou dost unravel the inextricably entangled threads of the
fates, and dost assuage the tempests of fortune and restrain the malignant
influences of the stars).—Generally it was the purpose of the rite
to destroy the “evil compulsion of the star” by magic power.</p>

<p class='c007'>The power of fate makes itself felt unpleasantly only when everything
goes against our will; that is to say when we no longer find ourselves
in harmony with ourselves. As I endeavored to show in my article,
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Bedeutung des Vaters</span>,” etc., the most dangerous power of fate lies
in the infantile libido fixation, localized in the unconscious. The power
of fate reveals itself at closer range as a compulsion of the libido;
wherefore Maeterlinck justly says that a Socrates could not possibly be
a tragic hero of the type of Hamlet. In accordance with this conception
the ancients had already placed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἱμαρμένη</span> (destiny) in relation to “Primal
Light,” or “Primal Fire.” In the Stoic conception of the primal cause,
the warmth spread everywhere, which has created everything and which
is therefore Destiny. (Compare Cumont: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mysterien des Mithra</span>,” p.
83.) This warmth is, as will later be shown, a symbol of the libido.
Another conception of the Ananke (necessity) is, according to the Book
of Zoroaster, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περὶ φύσεως</span> (concerning nature), that the air as wind had
once a connection with fertility. I am indebted to Rev. Dr. Keller of
Zurich for calling my attention to Bergson’s conception of the “durée
créatrice.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r94'>94</a>. The ascent to the “Idea” is described with unusual beauty in
Augustine (Bk. X, Ch. 8). The beginning of Ch. 8 reads: “I will raise

memory.”</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f95'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r95'>95</a>. The followers of Mithra also called themselves Brothers. In
philosophical speech Mithra was Logos emanating from God. (Cumont:
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Myst. des Mithra</span>,” p. 102.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the followers of Mithra there existed many Brotherhoods
which were called Thiasai and probably were the organizations from
which the Church developed later. (A. Kalthoff: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Entstehung des
Christentums.</span>”)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f96'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r96'>96</a>. <span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>Augustine, who stood in close relation to that period of transition not
only in point of time but also intellectually, writes in his “Confessions”
(Bk. VI, Ch. 16):</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor did I, unhappy, consider from what source it sprung, that even
on these things, foul as they were, I with pleasure discoursed with my
carnal pleasures. And yet these friends I loved for themselves only, and
friends; nor could I, even according to the notions I then had of
happiness, be happy without friends, amid what abundance soever of
I felt that I was beloved of them for myself only. O, crooked paths!
Woe to the audacious soul, which hoped, by forsaking Thee, to gain
some better thing! Turned it hath, and turned again, upon back, sides,
and belly, yet all was painful, and Thou alone rest!” (Trans. by
Pusey.)</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not only an unpsychologic but also an unscientific method of
procedure to characterize offhand such effects of religion as suggestion.
Such things are to be taken seriously as the expression of the deepest
psychologic need.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f97'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r97'>97</a>. Both religions teach a pronounced ascetic morality, but at the same
time a morality of action. The last is true also of Mithracism. Cumont
says that Mithracism owed its success to the value of its morale: “This
stimulated to action in an extraordinary degree” (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Myst. des Mithra</span>”).
The followers of Mithra formed a “sacred legion” for battle against
evil, and among them were virgins (nuns) and continents (ascetics).
Whether these brotherhoods had another meaning—that is, an economic-communistic
one—is something I will not discuss now. Here only the
religious-psychologic aspects interest us. Both religions have in common
the idea of the divine sacrifice. Just as Christ sacrificed himself as the
Lamb of God, so did Mithra sacrifice his Bull. This sacrifice in both
religions is the heart of the Mysteries. The sacrificial death of Christ
means the salvation of the world; from the sacrifice of the bull of
Mithra the entire creation springs.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f98'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r98'>98</a>. This analytic perception of the roots of the Mystery Religions is
necessarily one-sided, just as is the analysis of the basis of the religious
poem. In order to understand the actual causes of the repression in
Miss Miller one must delve into the moral history of the present; just
as one is obliged to seek in the ancient moral and economic history the
actual causes of repression which have given rise to the Mystery cults.
This investigation has been brilliantly carried out by Kalthoff. (See
his book, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Entstehung des Christentums</span>,” Leipzig 1904.) I also
refer especially to Pohlmann’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte des antiken Kommunismus
und Sozialismus</span>”; also to Bücher: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Aufstände der unfreien Arbeiter
143 bis 129 v. Chr.</span>,” 1874.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other cause of the enormous introversion of the libido in antiquity
is probably to be found in the fact that an unbelievably large part of
the people suffered in the wretched state of slavery. It is inevitable that
finally those who bask in good fortune would be infected in the mysterious
manner of the unconscious, by the deep sorrow and still deeper
misery of their brothers, through which some were driven into orgiastic
furies. Others, however, the better ones, sank into that strange world-weariness
and satiety of the intellectuals of that time. Thus from two
sources the great introversion was made possible.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f101'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r101'>101</a>. In a manner which is closely related to my thought, Kalthoff
(“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Entstehung des Christentums</span>”) understands the secularizing of the
religious interest as a new incarnation of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόγος</span> (word). He says:
“The profound grasp of the soul of nature evidenced in modern painting
and poetry, the living intuitive feeling which even science in its most
austere works can no longer do without, enables us easily to understand
how the Logos of Greek philosophy which assigned its place in the world
to the old Christ type, clothed in its world-to-come significance celebrated
a new incarnation.”</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f102'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r102'>102</a>. It seems, on account of the isolation of the cult, that this fact was
the cause of its ruin as well, because the eyes of that time were blinded
to the beauty of nature. Augustine (Bk. X, Ch. 6) very justly remarks:
“But they [men] were themselves undone through love for her [creation].”</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f103'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r103'>103</a>. Augustine (ibid.): “But what do I love when I love Thee, Oh God?
Not the bodily form, nor the earthly sweetness, nor the splendor of the
light, so dear to these eyes; nor the sweet melodies of the richly varied
songs; not the flowers and the sweet scented ointments and spices of
lovely fragrance; not manna and honey; not the limbs of the body
whose embraces are pleasant to the flesh. I do not love these when I
love my God, and yet the light, the voice, the fragrance, the food, the
embrace of my inner man; when these shine into my soul, which no
space contains, which no time takes away, where there is a fragrance
which the wind does not blow away, where there is a taste which no
gluttony diminishes and where harmony abides which no satiety can
remove—that is what I love, when I love my God.” (Perhaps a model

<p class='c007'><a href='#r109'>109</a>. This solution of the libido problem was brought about in a similar
manner by the flight from the world during the first Christian century.
(The cities of the Anchorites in the deserts of the Orient.) People
mortified themselves in order to become spiritual and thus escape the
extreme brutality of the decadent Roman civilization. Asceticism is
forced sublimation, and is always to be found where the animal impulses
are still so strong that they must be violently exterminated. The masked
self-murder of the ascetic needs no further biologic proof.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chamberlain (“Foundations of the Nineteenth Century”) sees in the
problem a biologic suicide because of the enormous amount of illegitimacy
among Mediterranean peoples at that time. I believe that illegitimacy
tends rather to mediocrity and to living for pleasure. It appears after
all that there were, at that time, fine and noble people who, disgusted
with the frightful chaos of that period which was merely an expression
of the disruption of the individual, put an end to their lives, and thus
caused the death of the old civilization with its endless wickedness.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r138'>138</a>. I emphasize this passage because its idea contains the psychological
root of the “Wandering of the soul in Heaven,” the conception of which
is very ancient. It is a conception of the wandering sun which from
its rising to its setting wanders over the world. The wandering gods
are representations of the sun, that is, symbols of the libido. This
comparison is indelibly impressed in the human phantasy as is shown by
the poem of Wesendonck:</p>

among the Greeks, where it was characterized as a fiery breath of air.
The Holy Ghost of the New Testament appears in the form of flames
around the heads of the Apostles, because the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πνεῦμα</span> was understood
to mean “fiery” (Dieterich: Ibid., p. 116). Very similar is the
Iranian conception of Hvarenô, by which is meant the “Grace of
Heaven” through which a monarch rules. By “Grace” is understood
a sort of fire or shining glory, something very substantial (Cumont:
Ibid., p. 70). We come across conceptions allied in character in Kerner’s
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Seherin von Prevorst</span>,” and in the case published by me, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Psychologie

souls consist of a spiritual light-substance, but the entire world is constructed
according to the white-black system of the Manichæans—and
this by a fifteen-year-old girl! The intellectual over-accomplishment
which I observed earlier in this creation, is now revealed as a consequence
of energetic introversion, which again roots up deep historical
strata of the soul and in which I perceive a regression to the memories
of humanity condensed in the unconscious.</p>

knowledge of the following case which presents an interesting symbolism.
It concerns a paranoic who passed over into a manifest megalomaniac
in the following way: She suddenly saw a <em>strong light</em>, a <em>wind blew</em> upon
her, she felt as if “her heart turned over,” and from that moment she
knew that God had visited her and was in her.</p>

<p class='c007'>I wish to refer here to the interesting correlation of mythological and
pathological forms disclosed in the analytical investigation of Dr. S.
Spielrein, and expressly emphasize that she has discovered the symbolisms
presented by her in the <cite>Jahrbuch</cite>, through independent experimental
work, in no way connected with my work.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r169'>169</a>. The development of the sun symbol in Faust does not go as far as
an anthropomorphic vision. It stops in the suicide scene at the chariot
of Helios (“A fiery chariot borne on buoyant pinions sweeps near me
now”). The fiery chariot comes to receive the dying or departing hero,
as in the ascension of Elijah or of Mithra. (Similarly Francis of
Assisi.) In his flight Faust passes over the sea, just as does Mithra.
The ancient Christian pictorial representations of the ascension of
Elijah are partly founded upon the corresponding Mithraic representations.
The horses of the sun-chariot rushing upwards to Heaven leave
the solid earth behind, and pursue their course over a water god, Oceanus,
lying at their feet. (Cumont: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Textes et Monuments.</span>” Bruxelles 1899,

<p class='c007'><a href='#r181'>181</a>. Compare Leblant: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sarcophages de la Gaule</span>,” 1880. In the “Homilies”
of Clement of Rome (“Hom.,” II, 23, cit. by Cumont) it is said:
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τῷ κυρίῳ γεγονάσιν δώδεκα ἀπόστολοι τῶν τοῦ ἡλίου δώδεκα μηνῶν φέροντες
τὸν ἀριθμόν</span> (The twelve apostles of the Lord, having the number of
the twelve months of the sun). As is apparent, this idea is concerned
with the course of the sun through the Zodiac. Without wishing to enter
upon an interpretation of the Zodiac, I mention that, according to the
ancient view (probably Chaldean), the course of the sun was represented
by a snake which carried the signs of the Zodiac on its back (similarly
to the Leontocephalic God of the Mithra mysteries). This view is proven
by a passage from a Vatican Codex edited by Cumont in another connection
(190, saec. XIII, p. 229, p. 85): “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τότε ὁ πάνσοφος δημιουργὸς ἄκρῳ
νεύματι ἐκίνησε τὸν μέγαν δράκοντα σὺν τῷ κεκοσμημένῳ στεφάνῳ, λέγω δὴ τὰ ἰβ’ ζῴδια,
βαστάζοντα ἐπὶ τοῦ νώτου αὐτοῦ</span>” (The all-wise maker of the world
set in motion the great dragon with the adorned crown, with a command
at the end. I speak now of the twelve images borne on the back of
this).</p>

<p class='c007'>This inner connection of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζῴδια</span> (small images) with the zodiacal
snake is worthy of notice and gives food for thought. The Manichæan
system attributes to Christ the symbol of the snake, and indeed of the
snake on the tree of Paradise. For this the quotation from John gives
far-reaching justification (John iii:14): “And as Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up.”
An old theologian, Hauff (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Biblische Real- und Verbalkonkordanz</span>,”
1834), makes this careful observation concerning this quotation: “Christ
considered the Old Testament story an unintentional symbol of the idea
of the atonement.” The almost bodily connection of the followers with
Christ is well known. (Romans xii:4): “For as we have many members
in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we being
many are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.”
If confirmation is needed that the zodiacal signs are symbols of the libido,
then the sentence in John i:29, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world,” assumes a significant meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r191'>191</a>. The projection into the “cosmic” is the primitive privilege of the
libido, for it enters into our perception naturally through all the avenues
of the senses, apparently from without, and in the form of pain and
pleasure connected with the objects. This we attribute to the object
without further thought, and we are inclined, in spite of our philosophic
considerations, to seek the causes in the object, which often has very
little concern with it. (Compare this with the Freudian conception of
Transference, especially Firenczi’s remarks in his paper, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Introjektion

of direct libido projection are found in erotic songs:</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, too, belong all the miraculous stories of cosmic events, phenomena
occurring at the birth and death of heroes. (The Star of Bethlehem;
earthquakes, the rending asunder of the temple hangings, etc., at the
death of Christ.) The omnipotence of God is the manifest omnipotence
of the libido, the only actual doer of wonders which we know. The
symptom described by Freud, as the “omnipotence of thought” in Compulsion
Neuroses arises from the “sexualizing” of the intellect. The
historical parallel for this is the magical omnipotence of the mystic,
attained by introversion. The “omnipotence of thought” corresponds to
the identification with God of the paranoic, arrived at similarly through
introversion.</p>

Schreber: Schreber’s divine rays composed by condensation of sun’s rays,
nerve fibres and sperma are really nothing else but the libido fixations
projected outside and objectively represented, and lend to his delusion
a striking agreement with our theory. That the world must come to
an end because the ego of the patient attracts all the rays to himself;
that later during the process of reconstruction he must be very anxious
lest God sever the connection of the rays with him: these and certain
other peculiarities of Schreber’s delusion sound very like the foregoing
endopsychic perceptions, on the assumption of which I have based the
interpretation of paranoia.</p>

present good, and desire to some future one—but joy and desire depend
upon the opinion of good; as desire being inflamed and provoked is carried
on eagerly toward what has the appearance of good, and joy is transported
and exults on obtaining what was desired: for we naturally pursue
those things that have the appearance of good, and avoid the contrary—wherefore
as soon as anything that has the appearance of good
presents itself, nature incites us to endeavor to obtain it. Now where this
strong desire is consistent and founded on prudence, it is by the stoics
called Bulesis and the name which we give it is volition, and this they
allow to none but their wise men, and define it thus; volition is a reasonable
desire; but whatever is incited too violently in opposition to reason,
that is a lust or an unbridled desire which is discoverable in all fools.—<em>The

<p class='c007'><a href='#r291'>291</a>. The stem <em>manth</em> according to Kuhn becomes in German
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">mangeln</span></i>, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">rollen</span></i> (referring to washing). Manthara is the butter
paddle. When the gods generated the amrta (drink of immortality)
by twirling the ocean around, they used the mountain Mandara as the
paddle (see Kuhn: Ibid., p. 17). Steinthal calls attention to the Latin
expression in poetical speech: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mentula</span></i> = male member, in which <em>ment</em>
(<em>manth</em>) was used. I add here also, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mentula</span></i> is to be taken as diminutive
for <em>menta</em> or <em>mentha</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίνθα</span>), <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Minze</span></i>. In antiquity the <em>Minze</em> was
called “Crown of Aphrodite” (Dioscorides, II, 154). Apuleius called
it “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mentha venerea</span>”; it was an aphrodisiac. (The opposite meaning is
found in Hippocrates: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si quis eam saepe comedat, ejus genitale semen
ita colliquescit, ut effluat, et arrigere prohibet et corpus imbecillum reddit</span>),
and according to Dioscorides, Minze is a means of preventing conception.
(See Aigremont: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volkserotik und Pflanzenwelt</span>,” Vol. I, p. 127). But the
ancients also said of Menta: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Menta autem appellata, quod suo odore
mentem feriat—mentae ipsius odor animum excitat.</span>” This leads us to
the root <em>ment</em>—in Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens</span></i>; English, mind—with which the parallel
development to <em>pramantha</em>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Προμηθεύς</span>, would be completed. Still to be
added is that an especially strong chin is called <em>mento</em> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mentum</span></i>).
A special development of the chin is given, as we know, to the priapic
figure of Pulcinello, also the pointed beard (and ears) of the satyrs and
the other priapic demon, just as in general all the protruding parts of
the body can be given a masculine significance and all the receding
parts or depressions a feminine significance. This applies also to all
other animate or inanimate objects. See Maeder: <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Psycho.-Neurol.

than a little uncertain.</p>

(“Kâtyâyanas Karmapradîpa,” I, 7; translated by Kuhn: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Herabkunft

is possible. The Germanic <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">bŏrôn</span></i> (to bore) is primarily related
to the Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forare</span></i> and the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαράω</span> = to plow. Possibly it is
an Indo-Germanic root <em>bher</em> with the meaning to bear; Sanscrit <em>bhar-</em>;
Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φερ</span>-; Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fer-</span></i>; from this Old High German <i><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">beran</span></i>, English to

to make fire by rubbing wood together and to set up a statue of Priapus, and
by that method to succor the cattle. After a Cistercian lay brother had

<p class='c007'><a href='#r304'>304</a>. This primitive play leads to the phallic symbolism of the plough.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀροῦν</span> means to plough and possesses in addition the poetic meaning
of impregnate. The Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">arare</span></i> means merely to plough, but the phrase
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fundum alienum arare</span>” means “to pluck cherries in a neighbor’s
garden.” A striking representation of the phallic plough is found on
a vase in the archeological museum in Florence. It portrays a row
of six naked ithyphallic men who carry a plough represented phallically
(Dieterich: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mutter Erde</span>,” p. 107). The “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">carrus navalis</span>” of our
spring festival (carnival) was at times during the Middle Ages a
plough (Hahn: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Demeter und Baubo</span>,” quoted by Dieterich: Ibid., p.
109). Dr. Abegg of Zurich called my attention to the clever work of
R. Meringer (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wörter und Sachen. Indogermanische Forschungen</span>,” 16,
179/84, 1904). We are made acquainted there with a very far-reaching
amalgamation of the libido symbols with the external materials and
external activities, which support our previous considerations to an
extraordinary degree. Meringer’s assumption proceeds from the two
Indo-Germanic roots, <em>ṷen</em> and <em>ṷeneti</em>. Indo-Germanic <em>*uen Holz</em>, ai.
ist. <em>van</em>, <em>vana</em>. Agni is <em>garbhas vanām</em>, “fruit of the womb of the
woods.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Indo-Germanic <em>*ṷeneti</em> signifies “he ploughs”: by that is meant the
penetration of the ground by means of a sharpened piece of wood and
the throwing up of the earth resulting from it. This verb itself is not
verified because this very primitive working of the ground was given
up at an early time. When a better treatment of the fields was learned,
the primitive designation for the ploughed field was given to the pasture,
therefore Gothic <i><span lang="got" xml:lang="got">vinja</span></i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">υομη</span>, Old Icelandic <i><span lang="is" xml:lang="is">vin</span></i>, pasture, meadow. Perhaps
also the Icelandic <i><span lang="is" xml:lang="is">Vanen</span></i>, as Gods of agriculture, came from that.</p>

<p class='c007'>From <em>ackern</em> (to plough) sprang <em>coïre</em> (the connection might have
been the other way); also Indo-Germanic <em>*ṷenos</em> (enjoyment of love),
Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">venus</span></i>. Compare with this the root <em>ṷen</em> = wood. <em>Coïre</em> = passionately
to strive; compare Old High German <i><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">vinnan</span></i>, to rave or to
storm; also the Gothic <i><span lang="got" xml:lang="got">vēns</span></i>; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐλπις</span> = hope; Old High German <i><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">wân</span></i> =
expectation, hope; Sanscrit <em>van</em>, to desire or need; further, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wonne</span></i> (delight,
ecstasy); Old Icelandic <i><span lang="is" xml:lang="is">vinr</span></i> (beloved, friend). From the meaning
<em>ackern</em> (to plough) arises <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wohnen</span></i> (to live). This transition has been
completed only in the German. From <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wohnen</span></i> → <em>gewöhnen</em>, <em>gewohnt sein</em>
(to be accustomed), Old Icelandic <i><span lang="is" xml:lang="is">vanr</span></i> = <em>gewohnt</em> (to be accustomed);
from <em>ackern</em> further → <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">sich mühen</span></i>, <em>plagen</em> (to take much trouble, wearing
work), Old Icelandic <i><span lang="is" xml:lang="is">vinna</span></i>, to work: Old High German <i><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">winnan</span></i> (to toil
hard, to overwork); Gothic <i><span lang="got" xml:lang="got">vinnan</span></i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάσχειν</span>; <em>vunns</em>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάθημα</span>. From <em>ackern</em>
comes, on the other hand, <em>gewinnen</em>, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">erlangen</span></i> (to win, to attain), Old
High German <i><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">giwinnan</span></i>, but also <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">verletzen</span></i> (to injure): Gothic <i><span lang="got" xml:lang="got">vunds</span></i>
(<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wund</span></i>), wound. <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wund</span></i> in the beginning, the most primal sense, was
therefore the ground torn up by the wooden implement. From <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">verletzen</span></i>
(to injure) come <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schlagen</span></i> (to strike), <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">besiegen</span></i> (to conquer): Old High

was for the purpose of rendering the field fertile, contains the primitive
thought in the most elementary form; by that the analogy was expressed
in the clearest manner: Just as I impregnate the woman, so do I impregnate
the earth. The symbol leads the sexual libido over to the cultivation
of the earth and to its fruitfulness. Compare with that Mannhardt:

<p class='c007'><a href='#r306'>306</a>. Spielrein’s patient (<cite>Jahrbuch</cite>, III, p. 371) associates fire and generation
in an unmistakable manner. She says as follows concerning it:
“One needs iron for the purpose of piercing the earth and for the
purpose of creating fire.” This is to be found in the Mithra liturgy as
well. In the invocation to the fire god, it is said: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ συνδήσας πνεύματι
τὰ πὑρινα κλεῖθρα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</span> (Thou who hast closed up the fiery locks of
heaven, with the breath of the spirit,—open to me). “With iron one
can create cold people from the stone.” The boring into the earth has
for her the meaning of fructification or birth. She says: “With the
glowing iron one can pierce through mountains. The iron becomes
glowing when one pushes it into a stone.”</p>

to bring about that natural satiety, as is the activity in its real place.
With this first step towards transformation, the first step towards the
characteristic dissatisfaction was also taken, which later drove man
from discovery to discovery without allowing him ever to attain satiety.
Thus it looks from the biological standpoint, which however is not the
only one possible.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r328'>328</a>. An Eranian name of fire is <em>Nairyôçağha</em> = masculine word. The
Hindoo <em>Narâçam̆sa</em> means wish of men (Spiegel: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erân. Altertumskunde</span>,”
II, 49). Fire has the significance of Logos (compare Ch. 7, “Siegfried”).
Of <em>Agni</em> (fire), Max Müller, in his introduction to “The Science
of Comparative Religions,” says: “It was a conception familiar to
India to consider the fire upon the altar as being at the same time
subject and object. The fire burned the sacrifice and was thereby similar
to the priest, the fire carried the sacrifice to the gods, and was thereby
an intercessor between men and the gods: fire itself, however, represented also something divine, a god, and when honor was to be shown
to this god, then fire was as much the subject as the object of the
sacrifice. Hence the first conception, that Agni sacrificed itself, i.e. that
it produced for itself its own sacrifice, and next that it brings itself
to the sacrifice.” The contact of this line of thought with the Christian
symbol is plainly apparent. Krishna utters the same thought in the
“Bhagavad-Gîtâ,” b. IV (translated by Arnold, London 1910):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>Is Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he</div>
      <div class='line'>Who, in such office, meditates on Brahm.”</div>
    </div>

<p class='c018'>The wise Diotima sees behind this symbol of fire (in Plato’s symposium,
c. 23). She teaches Socrates that Eros is “the intermediate
being between mortals and immortals, a great Demon, dear Socrates;
for everything demoniac is just the intermediate link between God and
man.” Eros has the task “of being interpreter and messenger from
men to the gods, and from the gods to men, from the former for their
prayers and sacrifices, from the latter for their commands and for
their compensations for the sacrifices, and thus filling up the gap between
both, so that through his mediation the whole is bound together with
itself.” Eros is a son of Penia (poverty, need) generated by Poros
intoxicated with nectar. The meaning of Poros is dark; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόρος</span> means way
and hole, opening. Zielinski: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Arch. f. Rel. Wissensch.</span>,” IX, 43 ff.,
places him with Phoroneus, identical with the fire-bringer, who is held
in doubt; others identify him with primal chaos, whereas others read
arbitrarily <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κόρος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μόρος</span>. Under these circumstances, the question
arises whether there may not be sought behind it a relatively simple
sexual symbolism. Eros would be then simply the son of Need and of
the female genitals, for this door is the beginning and birthplace of
fire. Diotima gives an excellent description of Eros: “He is manly,
daring, persevering, a strong hunter (archer, compare below) and an
incessant intriguer, who is constantly striving after wisdom,—a powerful
sorcerer, poison mixer and sophist; and he is respected neither as an
immortal nor as a mortal, but on the same day he first blooms and
blossoms, when he has attained the fulness of the striving, then dies
in it but always awakens again to life because of the nature of his
father (rebirth!); attainment, however, always tears him down
again.” For this characterization, compare Chs. V, VI and VII of this
work.</p>

translated by Wm. White, M.D., where a child is produced by the
parents placing a little turnip in the oven. The motive of the furnace
where the child is hatched is also found again in the type of the whale-dragon
myth. It is there a regularly recurring motive because the belly
of the dragon is very hot, so that as the result of the heat the hero
loses his hair—that is to say, he loses the characteristic covering of hair
of the adult and becomes a child. (Naturally the hair is related to
the sun’s rays, which are extinguished in the setting of the sun.)

libido blocked by the incest barrier regressively takes possession of an
older way of functioning anterior to the incestuous object of love. This
may be comprehended by Bleuler’s terminology, Autismus, that is, the
function of pure self-preservation, which is especially distinguished by
the function of nutrition. However, the terminology “autismus” cannot
very well be longer applied to the presexual material, because it is
already used in reference to the mental state of dementia praecox where
it has to include autoerotism plus introverted desexualized libido.
Autismus designates first of all a pathological phenomenon of regressive
character, the presexual material, however, of a normal functioning, the
chrysalis stage.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r351'>351</a>. How very important is the coronation and sun identification, is
shown not alone from countless old customs, but also from the corresponding
ancient metaphors in the religious speech: the Wisdom of
Solomon v: 17: “Therefore, they will receive a beautiful crown from
the hand of the Lord.” <cite>I Peter</cite> v: 4: “Feed the flock of God&nbsp;... and
when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory
that fadeth not away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a church hymn of Allendorf it is said of the soul: “The soul is
liberated from all care and pain and in dying it has come to the <em>crown
of joy</em>; she stands as bride and queen in the <em>glitter of eternal splendor</em>,
at the side of the great king,” etc. In a hymn by Laurentius Laurentii
it is said (also of the soul): “The crown is entrusted to the brides
because they conquer.” In a song by Sacer we find the passage: “Adorn
my coffin with garlands just as a conqueror is adorned,—from those
springs of heaven, my soul has attained the eternally green crown: the
true glory of victory, coming from the son of God who has so cared
for me.” A quotation from the above-mentioned song of Allendorf is
added here, in which we have another complete expression of the primitive
psychology of the sun identification of men, which we met in the
Egyptian song of triumph of the ascending soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>(Concerning the soul, continuation of the above passage:) “It [the
soul] sees a clear countenance [sun]: his [the sun’s] joyful loving nature
now restores it through and through: it is a <em>light in his light</em>.—Now the
<em>child can see the father</em>: He feels the gentle emotion of love. Now he
can understand the word of Jesus. He himself, the father, has loved
you. An unfathomable sea of benefits, an abyss of eternal waves of
blessing is disclosed to the enlightened spirit: he beholds the countenance
of God, and knows what signifies <em>the inheritor of God in light and the
co-heir of Christ</em>.—The feeble body rests on the earth: it sleeps until
Jesus awakens it. <em>Then will the dust become the sun</em>, which now is
covered by the dark cavern: Then shall we come together with all the
pious, who knows how soon, and will be for eternity with the Lord.” I

themselves, so that I need add nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r354'>354</a>. The identity of the divine hero with the mystic is not to be
doubted. In a prayer written on papyrus to Hermes, it is said: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σὺ γὰρ
ἐγὼ καὶ ἐγὼ σύ· τὸ σόν ὄνομα ἐμὸν καὶ τὸ ἐμὸν σὸν· ἐγὼ γὰρ εἰμι τὸ εἴθολόν σου</span><a id='t520'></a> (For
thou art I and I am thou, thy name is mine, and mine is thine; for
I am thy image). (Kenyon: Greek Papyrus, in the British Museum,
1893, p. 116, Pap. CXXII, 2. Cited by Dieterich: “Mithrasliturgie,”
p. 79.) The hero as image of the libido is strikingly illustrated in the
head of Dionysus at Leiden (Roscher, I, Sp. 1128), where the hair rises
like flame over the head. He is—like a flame: “Thy savior will be
a flame.” Firmicus Maternus (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Errore Prof. Relig.</span>,” 104, p. 28) acquaints
us with the fact that the god was saluted as bridegroom, and
“young light.” He transmits the corrupt Greek sentence, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δε νυνφε
χαιρε νυνφε νεον φως</span>, with which he contrasts the Christian conception:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullum apud te lumen est nec est aliquis qui sponsus mereatur audire:
unum lumen est, unus est sponsus. Nominum horum gratiam Christus
accepit.</span>” To-day Christ is still our hero and the bridegroom of the soul.

themselves obliged to ridicule in an airy manner this connection. The

and gold are always associated together. Grimm tells us of the following
magic charm: “If one wants money in his house the whole year,
one must eat lentils on New Year’s Day.” This notable connection is
explained simply through the physiological fact of the indigestibility of
lentils, which appear again in the form of coins. Thus one becomes a

way the name of the legendary man who invented the cuneiform characters has been preserved (as, for example, Sinlikiunnini as the poet
of the Gilgamesh epic). But I have not succeeded in finding anything
of that sort. However, Ashshurbanaplu or Asurbanipal has left behind
that marvellous cuneiform library, which was excavated in Kujundschik.
Perhaps “Asurubama” has something to do with this name. Further
there comes into consideration the name of Aholibamah, which we have
met in Part I. The word “Ahamarama” betrays equally some connections
with Anah and Aholibamah, those daughters of Cain with the
sinful passion for the sons of God. This possibility hints at Chiwantopel
as the longed-for son of God. (Did Byron think of the two sister whores,

the strength of the sun-bull. Alexander is often found upon coins with
the horns of Jupiter Ammon. It is a question of identification of the
ruler around whom so many legends are clustered, with the sun of spring
in the signs of the bull and the ram. It is obvious that humanity had
a great need of effacing the personal and human from their heroes, so
as finally to make them, through a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετάστασις</span> (eclipse), the equal of
the sun, that is to say, completely into a libido-symbol. If we thought

for the infant out of the straw, he was already grown and spoke “words
of wisdom.” The quick growth of the hero, a frequently recurring

hero are so extraordinary because his birth really means his rebirth,
therefore he becomes very quickly adapted to his hero rôle. Compare

extraordinarily significant. The Dadophores are harmless gods of light
who do not participate in the sacrifice. The animal is lacking in the
sacrifice of Christ. Therefore there are two criminals who suffer the
same death. The scene is much more dramatic. The inner connection
of the Dadophores to Mithra, of which I will speak later, allows us
to assume the same relation of Christ to the criminals. The scene with
Barabbas betrays that Christ is the god of the ending year, who is
represented by one of the thieves, while the one of the coming year is

with Xisuthros) had consecrated to the highest god in Thebes a vessel
280 els long. In the dialogue of Lucius (Apuleius: “Metam.,” lib. II,

“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hac enim sitarchia navigium Veneris indiget sola, ut in nocte pervigili

this provision in order that during the night the lamp may abound with

“I have come to set a man at variance with his father, a daughter with
her mother. He who loves father and mother more than me is not
worthy of me.” This directly hostile purpose, which calls to mind the
legendary rôle of Bertran de Born, is directed against the incestuous
bond and compels man to transfer his libido to the Saviour, who, dying,
returning into his mother and rising again, is the hero Christ.</p>

prey upon woman’s flesh and they will burn with fire.” The horn, a
phallic emblem, is in the unicorn the symbol of the Holy Ghost (Logos).
The unicorn is hunted by the archangel Gabriel, and driven into the lap
of the Virgin, by which was understood the immaculate conception. But
the horns are also sun’s rays, therefore the sun-gods are often horned.
The sun phallus is the prototype of the horn (sun wheel and phallus
wheel), therefore the horn is the symbol of power. Here the horns
“burn with fire” and prey upon the flesh; one recognizes in this a
representation of the pains of hell where souls were burnt by the fire
of the libido (unsatisfied longing). The harlot is “consumed” or
burned by unsatisfied longing (libido). Prometheus suffers a similar
fate, when the eagle, sun-bird (libido), tears his intestines: one might
also say, that he was pierced by the “horn.” I refer to the phallic

Theophrastus it occurs with the meaning of “young scion.”) The
related word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρνίς</span> designates a festival annually celebrated in honor
of Linos, in which the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λίνος</span>, the lament called Linos, was sung as a
lamentation for Linos, the new-born son of Psamathe and Apollo, torn
to pieces by dogs. The mother had exposed her child out of fear of
her father Krotopos. But for revenge Apollo sent a dragon, Poine,
into Krotopos’ land. The oracle of Delphi commanded a yearly lament
by women and maidens for the dead Linos. A part of the honor was
given to Psamathe. The Linos lament is, as Herodotus shows (II, 79),
identical with the Phœnician, Cyprian and Egyptian custom of the
Adonis-(Tammuz) lament. As Herodotus observes, Linos is called
Maneros in Egypt. Brugsch points out that Maneros comes from the
Egyptian cry of lamentation, <em>maa-n-chru</em>: “come to the call.” Poine is
characterized by her tearing the children from the womb of all mothers.
This ensemble of motives is found again in the Apocalypse, xii: 1–5,
where it treats of the woman, whose child was threatened by a dragon
but was snatched away into the heavens. The child-murder of Herod
is an anthropomorphism of this “primitive” idea. The lamb means the
son. (See Brugsch: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Adonisklage und das Linoslied</span>,” Berlin
1852.) Dieterich (Abraxas: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Studien zur Religionsgeschichte des
späteren Altertums</span>,” 1891) refers for an explanation of this passage to
the myth of Apollo and Python, which he reproduces as follows: “To
Python, the son of earth, the great dragon, it was prophesied that the
son of Leto would kill him; Leto was pregnant by Zeus: but Hera
brought it about that she <em>could give birth only there where the sun did
not shine</em>. When Python saw that Leto was pregnant, he began to pursue
her in order to kill her, but Boreas brought Leto to Poseidon. The
latter brought her to Ortygia and covered the island with the waves of
the sea. When Python did not find Leto, he returned to Parnassus.
Leto brought forth upon the island thrown up by Poseidon. The fourth
day after the birth, Apollo took revenge and killed the Python.” The
birth upon the hidden island belongs to the motive of the “night journey
on the sea.” The typical character of the “island phantasy” has for
the first time been correctly perceived by Riklin (1912 <cite>Jahrbuch</cite>, Vol. II,
p. 246). A beautiful parallel for this is to be found, together with the
necessary incestuous phantasy material, in H. de Vere Stacpool: “The
Blue Lagoon.” A parallel to “Paul and Virginia.”</p>

the church with the mother is not to be doubted, also the conception
of the mother as spouse. The virgin is necessarily introduced to hide
the incest idea. The “community with the male” points to the motive
of the continuous cohabitation. The “twin nestlings” refer to the old
legend, that Jesus and Thomas were twins. It plainly expresses the
motive of the Dioscuri. Therefore, doubting Thomas had to place his
finger in the wound at the side. Zinzendorf has correctly perceived the
sexual significance of this symbol that hints at the androgynous nature
of the primitive being (the libido). Compare the Persian legend of
the twin trees Meschia and Mechiane, as well as the motive of the
Dioscuri and the motive of cohabitation.</p>

perhaps of the name Joshua, appears in the changing relation of lover
and son towards a mythical Mary. This is a natural process in the
oldest theosophy and one which appears with variations in the myths of
Mithra, Adonis, Attis, Osiris and Dionysus, all of whom were brought

machinery. It stirs our being and makes it joyous and living. Everything
we dream of as beautiful and noble is included here. Sexuality
and sensuousness are the spirit of music, of painting and of all art. All
wishes of mankind rotate around this center like moths around a
burning light. The sense of beauty and the feeling for art are only
other expressions of it. They signify nothing more than the impulse
of mankind towards expression. I consider devoutness itself as a diverted
channel of the sexual desire.” Here it is openly declared that one should
never forget when judging the ancient ecclesiastic art that the effort
to efface the boundaries between earthly and divine love, to blend them

this tends only to separate man from his essential and highest ethical
goal, moral autonomy. The religious symbol should be retained after
the inevitable obliteration of certain antiquated fragments, as postulate
or as transcendent theory, and also as taught in precepts, but is to be
filled with new meaning according to the demand of the culture of
the present day. But this theory must not become for the “adult” a
positive creed, an illusion, which causes reality to appear to him in a
false light. Just as man is a dual being, having an intellectual and
an animal nature, so does he appear to need two forms of reality, the
reality of culture, that is, the symbolic transcendent theory, and the
reality of nature which corresponds to our conception of the “true
reality.” In the same measure that the true reality is merely a figurative
interpretation of the appreciation of reality, the religious symbolic theory
is merely a figurative interpretation of certain endopsychic apperceptions.
But one very essential difference is that a transcendental support, independent
in duration and condition, is assured to the transubjective reality
through the best conceivable guarantees, while for the psychologic phenomena
a transcendental support of subjective limitation and weakness
must be recognized as a result of compelling empirical data. Therefore
true reality is one that is relatively universally valid; the psychologic
reality, on the contrary, is merely a functional phenomenon contained
in an epoch of human civilization. Thus does it appear to-day from
the best informed empirical standpoint. If, however, the psychologic
were divested of its character of a biologic epiphenomenon in a manner
neither known nor expected by me, and thereby was given the place of
a physical entity, then the psychologic reality would be resolved into
the true reality; or much more, it would be reversed, because then the
psychologic would lay claim to a greater worth, for the ultimate theory,
because of its directness.</p>

than properly belongs to the term. Just as libido is the onward
driving force, so incest is in some manner the backward urge into childhood.
For the child, it cannot be spoken of as incest. Only for the adult
who possesses a completely formed sexuality does the backward urge become
incest, because he is no longer a child but possesses a sexuality
which cannot be permitted a regressive application.</p>

The dog is also a regular companion of the healing Asclepius.
The following quotation from Petronius best supports the Creuzer

that because of your beneficence I may attain to life after death). See
Nork: Ibid., about dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, the relation of the dog to the dog-headed Hecate, the goddess
of the underworld, hints at its being the symbol of rebirth. She received
as Canicula a sacrificial dog to keep away the pest. Her close relation
to Artemis as goddess of the moon permits her opposition to fertility
to be glimpsed. Hecate, is also the first to bring to Demeter the news
of her stolen child (the rôle of Anubis!). Also the goddess of birth
Ilithyia received sacrifices of dogs, and Hecate herself is, on occasions,
goddess of marriage and birth.</p>

(sun-heroes) lack a member. He gives the following parallel: “Just
as the god wrenches out an arm from the ogre (giant), so does Odysseus
pluck out the eye of the noble Polyphemus, whereupon the sun creeps up
mysteriously into the sky. Might the fire-making, twisting and wrenching
out of the arm be connected?” This question is by this clearly illumined
if we assume, corresponding to the train of thought of the ancients, that
the wrenching out of the arm is really a castration. (The symbol of
the robbery of the force of life.) It is an act corresponding to the Attis
castration because of the mother. From this renunciation, which is really
a symbolic mother incest, arises the discovery of fire, as previously we
have already suspected. Moreover, mention must be made of the fact
that to wrench out an arm, means first of all merely “overpowering,”
and on that account can happen to the hero as well as to his opponent.

<p class='c007'><a href='#r496'>496</a>. The motive of the “striking rocks” belongs also to the motive of
devouring (Frobenius: Ibid., p. 405). The hero in his ship must pass
between two rocks which strike together. (Similar to the biting door,
to the tree trunk which snaps together.) In the passage, generally the
tail of the bird is pinched off (or the “poop” of the ship, etc.); the
castration motive is once more clearly revealed here, for the castration
takes the place of mother incest. The castration is a substitution for
coitus. Scheffel employs this idea in his well-known poem: “A herring
loved an oyster, etc.” The poem ends with the oyster biting off the
herring’s head for a kiss. The doves which bring Zeus ambrosia have
also to pass through the rocks which strike together. The “doves”
bring the food of immortality to Zeus by means of incest (entrance into
the mother) very similar to Freya’s apples (breasts). Frobenius also
mentions the rocks or caves which open only at a magic word and are
very closely connected with the rocks which strike together. Most
illuminating in this respect is a South African myth (Frobenius, p. 407):
“One must call the rock by name and cry loudly: Rock Utunjambili,
open, so that I may enter.” But the rock answers when it will not open
to the call. “The rock will not open to children, it will open to the
swallows which fly in the air!” The remarkable thing is, that no human
power can open the rock, only a formula has that power—or a bird.
This wording merely says that the opening of the rock is an undertaking
which cannot really be accomplished, but which one wishes to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c007'>(In Middle High German, to wish is really “to have the power to
create something extraordinary.”) When a man dies, then only the
wish that he might live remains, an unfulfilled wish, a fluttering wish,
wherefore souls are birds. The soul is wholly only libido, as is illustrated
in many parts of this work; it is “to wish.” Thus the helpful
bird, who assists the hero in the whale to come again into the light,
who opens the rocks, is the wish for rebirth. (For the bird as
a wish, see the beautiful painting by Thoma, where the youth longingly
stretches out his arms to the birds who pass over his head.)</p>

reads: “A linden shall be planted, which shall bear on high two boughs
from the wood of which a “poie” shall be made; the child who will
be the first to lie therein is destined to be taken by the sword from life

<p class='c007'><a href='#r542'>542</a>. Just as the tree has the phallic nature as well as a maternal significance,
so in myths the demonic old woman (she may be favorable
or malicious) often has phallic attributes, for example, a long toe, a
long tooth, long lips, long fingers, pendulous breasts, large hands, feet,
and so on. This mixture of male and female motive has reference to
the fact that the old woman is a libido symbol like the tree, generally
determined as maternal. The bisexuality of the libido is expressed in
its clearest form in the idea of the three witches, who collectively possessed
but one eye and one tooth. This idea is directly parallel to the
dream of a patient, who represented her libido as twins, one of which
is a box, the other a bottle-like object, for eye and tooth represent male
and female genitals. Relative to eye in this connection, see especially
the Egyptian myths: referring to tooth, it is to be observed that Adonis
(fecundity) died by a boar’s tooth, like Siegfried by Hagen’s spear:
compare with this the Veronese Priapus, whose phallus was bitten by a
snake. Tooth in this sense, like the snake, is a “negative” phallus.</p>

another application is found in a Low-Saxon legend: Once a young ash
tree grew unnoticed in the wood. Each New Year’s Eve a white knight
upon a white horse rides up to cut down the young shoot. At the same
time a black knight arrives and engages him in combat. After a lengthy
conflict, the white knight succeeds in overcoming the black knight and
the white knight cuts down the young tree. But sometime the white
knight will be unsuccessful, then the ash will grow, and when it becomes
large enough to allow a horse to be tied under it, then a powerful king
will come and a tremendous battle will occur (destruction of the world).</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r605'>605</a>. Apuleius (“Metam.,” Book II, 31) made use of the symbolism

en! Ipse vigor attendit et oppido formido, ne nervus rigoris nimietate

<p class='c007'><a href='#r607'>607</a>. Spielrein’s patient (<cite>Jahrbuch</cite>, III, p. 371) has also the idea of the
cleavage of the earth in a similar connection. “Iron is used for the
purpose of penetrating into the earth&nbsp;... with iron man can&nbsp;...
create men&nbsp;... the earth is split, burst open, man is divided&nbsp;... is
severed and reunited. In order to make an end of the burial of the
living, Jesus Christ calls his disciples to penetrate into the earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The motive of “cleavage” is of general significance. The Persian
hero Tishtriya, who also appeared as a white horse, opens the rain
lake, and thus makes the earth fruitful. He is called Tîr = arrow.
He was also represented as feminine, with a bow and arrow. Mithra
with his arrow shot the water from the rock, so as to end the drought.
The knife is sometimes found stuck in the earth. In Mithraic monuments
sometimes it is the sacrificial instrument which kills the bull. (Cumont:

<p class='c007'><a href='#r610'>610</a>. This is also represented mythologically in the legend of Theseus

With this aim they enter a chasm in the earth in the grove Kolonos,
in order to get down to the underworld; when they were below they
wished to rest, but being enchanted they hung on the rocks, that is to
say, they remained fixed in the mother and were therefore lost for the
upperworld. Later Theseus was freed by Hercules (revenge of Horus
for Osiris), at which time Hercules appears in the rôle of the death-conquering
hero.</p>

horse, a serpent came out of it and bit him on the foot. Then he became
sick and died. When Indra in the form of Çyena, the falcon, stole the

arrow (“Rigveda,” I, 155; IV, 322).</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f614'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r614'>614</a>. Similar to the Lord of the Grail who guards the chalice, the mother
symbol. The myth of Philoctetes is taken from a more involved connection,
the Hercules myth. Hercules has two mothers, the benevolent
Alcmene and the pursuing Hera (Lamia), from whose breast he has
absorbed immortality. Hercules conquered Hera’s serpent while yet
in the cradle; that is to say, conquered the “terrible mother,” the Lamia.
But from time to time Hera sent to him attacks of madness, in one of
which he killed his children (Lamia motive). According to an interesting
tradition, this deed occurred at the moment when Hercules
refused to perform a great act in the service of Eurystheus. As a result
of the refusal, the libido, in readiness for the work, regressed in a
typical manner to the unconscious mother-imago, which resulted in
madness (as to-day), during which Hercules identifies himself with
Lamia (Hera) and murders his own children. The delphic oracle
communicates to him the fact that he is named Hercules because he owes
his immortal fame to Hera, who through her persecution compelled him
to great deeds. It can be seen that “the great deed” really means the
conquering of the mother and through her to win immortality. His
characteristic weapon, the club, he cuts from the maternal olive tree.
Like the sun, he possessed the arrows of Apollo. He conquered the
Nemean lion in his cave, which has the signification of “the grave in
the mother’s womb” (see the end of this chapter). Then follows the
combat with the Hydra, the typical battle with the dragon; the complete
conquering of the mother. (See below.) Following this, the capture
of the Cerynean doe, whom he wounded with an arrow in the foot.
This is what generally happens to the hero, but here it is reversed.
Hercules showed the captured Erymanthian boar to Eurystheus, whereupon
the latter in fear crept into a cask. That is, he died. The
Stymphalides, the Cretan bull, and the man-devouring horse of Diomedes
are symbols of the devastating powers of death, among which the latter’s
relation to the mother may be recognized especially. The battle for
the precious girdle of the Amazon queen Hippolyte permits us to see
once more very clearly the shadow of the mother. Hippolyte is ready
to give up the girdle, but Hera, changing herself into the form of
Hippolyte, calls the Amazons against Hercules in battle. (Compare
Horus, fighting for the head ornament of Isis, about which there is
more later. Chap. 7.) The liberation of Hesione results from Hercules
journeying downwards with his ship into the belly of the monster,
and killing the monster from within after three days labor. (Jonah
motive; Christ in the tomb or in hell; the victory over death by creeping
into the womb of the mother, and its destruction in the form of the
mother. The libido in the form of the beautiful maiden again conquered.)
The expedition to Erythia is a parallel to Gilgamesh, also to
Moses, in the Koran, whose goal was the confluence of the two seas:
it is the journey of the sun to the Western sea, where Hercules discovered
the straits of Gibraltar (“to that passage”: Faust), and with the
ship of Helios set out towards Erythia. There he overcame the gigantic
guardian Eurytion (Chumbaba in the Gilgamesh epic, the symbol of
the father), then the triune Geryon (a monster of phallic libido symbolism),
and at the same time wounded Hera, hastening to the help
of Geryon by an arrow shot. Then the robbery of the herd followed.
“The treasure attained with difficulty” is here presented in surroundings
which make it truly unmistakable. Hercules, like the sun, goes to
death, down into the mother (Western sea), but conquers the libido
attached to the mother and returns with the wonderful kine; he has
won back his libido, his life, the mighty possession. We discover the
same thought in the robbery of the golden apples of Hesperides, which
are defended by the hundred-headed dragon. The victory over Cerberus
is also easily understood as the victory over death by entrance
into the mother (underworld). In order to come to his wife Deianira,
he has to undergo a terrible battle with a water god, Achelous (with
the mother). The ferryman Nessus (a centaur) violates Deianira.
With his sun arrows Hercules killed this adversary, but Nessus advised
Deianira to preserve his poisoned blood as a love charm. When after
the insane murder of Iphitus Delphi denied him the speech of the
oracle, he took possession of the sacred tripod. The delphic oracle then
compelled him to become a slave of Omphale, who made him like
a child. After this Hercules returned home to Deianira, who presented
him with the garment poisoned with Nessus’ blood (the Isis snake),
which immediately clung so closely to his skin that he in vain attempted
to tear it off. (The casting of the skin of the aging sun-god; Serpent,
as symbol of rejuvenation.) Hercules then ascended the funeral pyre
in order to destroy himself by fire like the phœnix, that is to say, to
give birth to himself again from his own egg. No one but young
Philoctetes dared to sacrifice the god. Therefore Philoctetes received
the arrows of the sun and the libido myth was renewed with this
Horus.</p>

monster comes out of the sea. Hippolytos’ horses shy and drag Hippolytos

<div class='footnote' id='f623'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r623'>623</a>. Robertson (“Evangelical Myths,” p. 130) gives an interesting contribution
to the question of the symbol of the carrying of the cross.
Samson carried the “pillars of the gates from Gaza and died between
the columns of the temple of the Philistines.” Hercules, weighted down
by his burden, carried his columns to the place (Gades), where he also
died according to the Syrian version of the legend. The columns of
Hercules mark the western point where the sun sinks into the sea. In
old art he was actually represented carrying the two columns under
his arms in such a way that they exactly formed a cross. Here we
perhaps have the origin of the myth of Jesus, who carries his own
cross to the place of execution. It is worth noting that the three
synoptics substitute a man of the name of Simon from Cyrene as bearer
of the cross. Cyrene is in Libya, the legendary scene upon which
Hercules performed the labor of carrying the columns, as we have
seen, and Simon (Simson) is the nearest Greek name-form for Samson,
which in Greek might have been read Simson, as in Hebrew. But in
Palestine it was Simon, Semo or Sem, actually a name of a god, who
represented the old sun-god Semesch, who was identified with Baal, from
whose myth the Samson myth has doubtless arisen. The god Simon
enjoyed especial honor in Samaria. “The cross of Hercules might well
be the sun’s wheel, for which the Greeks had the symbol of the cross.
The sun’s wheel upon the bas-relief in the small metropolis at Athens
contains a cross, which is very similar to the Maltese cross.” (See Thiele:
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Antike Himmelsbilder</span>,” 1898, p. 59.)</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f624'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r624'>624</a>. The Greek myth of Ixion, who was bound to the “four-spoked
wheel,” says this almost without disguise. Ixion first murdered his
stepfather, but later was absolved from guilt by Zeus and blessed with
his favor. But the ingrate attempted to seduce Hera, the mother. Zeus
deceived him, however, allowing the goddess of the clouds, Nephele, to
assume Hera’s form. (From this connection the centaurs have arisen.)
Ixion boasted of his deed, but Zeus as a punishment plunged him into
the underworld, where he was bound to a wheel continually whirled
around by the wind. (Compare the punishment of Francesca da Rimini
in Dante and the “penitents” by Segantini.)</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r685'>685</a>. As an example among many, I mention here the Polynesian Rata
myth cited by Frobenius: Ibid., pp. 64–66: “With a favorable wind the
boat was sailing easily away over the Ocean, when Nganaoa called out
one day: ‘O Rata, here is a fearful enemy who rises up from the
Ocean!’ It was an open mussel of huge dimensions. One shell was
in front of the boat, the other behind it, and the vessel was directly
between. The next moment the horrible mussel would have clapped its
shells together and ground the boat and occupants to pieces in its grip.
But Nganaoa was prepared for this possibility. He grasped his long
spear and quickly plunged it into the belly of the animal so that the
creature, instead of snapping together, at once sank back to the bottom
of the sea. After they had escaped from this danger they continued on
their way. But after a while the voice of the always watchful Nganaoa
was again to be heard. ‘O Rata, once more a terrible enemy rushes
upwards from the depths of the ocean.’ This time it was a mighty
octopus, whose gigantic tentacles already surrounded the boat, in order
to destroy it. At this critical moment, Nganaoa seized his spear, and
plunged it into the head of the octopus. The tentacles sank away limp
and the dead monster rose to the surface of the water. Once more they
continued on their journey, but a yet greater danger awaited them.
One day the valiant Nganaoa called out, ‘O Rata, here is a great
whale!’ The huge jaws were wide open, the lower jaw was already
under the boat, and the upper one over it. One moment more and the
whale would have devoured them. Now Nganaoa ‘the dragon slayer’
broke his spear into two parts, and at the moment when the whale was
about to devour them, he stuck the two pieces into the jaws of the foe
so that he could not close his jaws. Nganaoa quickly sprang into the
jaws of the great whale (devouring of the hero) and looked into its
belly, and what did he see? There sat both his parents, his father,
Tairitokerau, and his mother, Vaiaroa, who had been gulped down into
the depths of this monster. The oracle has come true. The voyage has
come to its end. Great was the joy of the parents of Nganaoa when they
saw their son. They were convinced that their freedom was at hand.
And Nganaoa resolved upon revenge. He took one of the two pieces
from the jaws of the animal—one was enough to make it impossible for
the whale to close his jaws and so keep a passage free for Nganaoa
and his parents. He broke this part of the spear in two, in order to
use them as wood to produce fire by rubbing. He commanded his father
to hold one firmly below, while he himself managed the upper one, until
the fire began to glimmer (production of fire). Now when he blew this
into flames, he hastened to heat the fatty part (heart) of the belly with
the fire. The monster, writhing with pain, sought help swimming to
the nearest land (journey in the sea). As soon as he reached the sandbank
(land) father, mother and son walked onto the land through the
open jaws of the dying whale (slipping out of the hero).”</p>

prayer becomes a pregnant cow. In Persian it is the “Eye of Ahura”;
Babylonian <em>Nabu</em>: the word of fate; Persian <em>vohu mano</em>: the good
thought of the creator God; in Stoic conceptions, Hermes is <em>logos</em> or
world intellect; in Alexandria the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σοφία</span>, in the Old Testament it is the
angel of Jehovah, or the countenance of God. Jacob wrestled with
the angel during the night at the ford of Jabbok, after he had crossed
the water with all that he possessed. (Night journey on the sea, battle
with the night snake, combat at the ford like Hiawatha.) In this
combat, Jacob dislocated his thigh. (Motive of the twisting out of the
arm. Castration on account of the overpowering of the mother.) This
“face” of God was compared in the old Jewish philosophy to the
mystic Metatron, the prince of the face of God (Josiah 5, 14), who
brings “the prayer to God” and “in whom is the name of God.” The
Naassens (Ophits) called the Holy Ghost the “first word,” the mother
of all that lives; the Valentinians comprehended the descending dove
of Pneuma as “the word of the mother from above, the Sophia.”

being of great wisdom, “a very old Nature God,” with whom the
Norse gods associate. Later fables make of him a demon and a skilful
smith (closest relation to Wieland). Just as Wotan obtained advice
from the wise woman (compare the quotation from Julius Cæsar about
the German matron), so does Odin go to the brook of Mîmir in which
wisdom and judgment lie hidden, to the spiritual mother (mother-imago).
There he requests a drink (drink of immortality), but no
sooner does he receive it than he sacrifices his eye to the well (death
of the sun in the sea). The well of Mîmir points undoubtedly to the
mother significance of Mîmir. Thus Mîmir gets possession of Odin’s
other eye. In Mîmir, the mother (wise giant) and the embryo (dwarf,
subterranean sun, Harpocrates) is condensed; likewise, as mother, he is
the source of wisdom and art. (“Mother-imago” therefore may be

<p class='c007'><a href='#r747'>747</a>. Compare the stable cleaning of Hercules. The stable, like the
cavern, is a place of birth. We find stable and cavern in Mithracism
combined with the bull symbolism, as in Christianity. (See Robertson:
“Christ and Krishna.”) In a Basuto myth, the stable birth also occurs.
(Frobenius.) The stable birth belongs to the mythologic animal fable;
therefore the legend of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">conceptio immaculata</span>, allied to the history
of the impregnation of the barren Sarah, appears very early in Egypt as
an animal fable. Herodotus, III, 28, relates: “This Apis or Epaphos
is a calf whose mother was unable to become impregnated, but the
Egyptians said that a ray from heaven fell upon the cow, and from
that she brought forth Apis.” Apis symbolizes the sun, therefore his
signs: upon the forehead a white spot, upon his back a figure of an
eagle, upon his tongue a beetle.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f748'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r748'>748</a>. According to Philo, the serpent is the most spirited of all animals;
its nature is that of fire, the rapidity of its movements is great and this
without need of any especial limbs. It has a long life and sheds age,
with its skin. Therefore it was inculcated in the mysteries, because it is
immortal. (Maehly: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Schlange in Mythologie und Kultus der

<p class='c007'><a href='#r750'>750</a>. “And the woman—having a golden cup in her hand full of
abominations and filthiness of her fornication” (Rev. xvii:4). The
woman is “drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of
the martyrs of Jesus”: a striking image of the terrible mother (here,
cup = genitals). In the Tibetan myth of Bogda Gesser Khan there
is a beetle (treasure attainable with difficulty), which the demoniac
old woman guards. Gesser says to her: “Sister, never since I was
born have you shown me the beetle my soul.” The mother libido
is also the soul. It is significant that the old woman desired the hero
as a husband. (Frobenius.)</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f751'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r751'>751</a>. <span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>This is also the significance of the mysteries. Their purpose is to
lead the useless, regressive incestuous libido over the bridges of symbolism
into rational activity, and through that transform the obscure
compulsion of the libido working up from the unconscious into social
communion and higher moral endeavor.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f752'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r752'>752</a>. An excellent example of this is the description of the orgies of the
Russian sectarian by Mereschkowski, in his book, “Peter the Great and
Alexei.” In the cult of the Asiatic Goddesses of love (Anaïtis, Mylitta,
etc.), prostitution in the temple was an organized institution. The
orgiastic cult of Anâhita (Anaïtis) has been preserved in modern sects,
with the Ali Illâhîja, the so-called “extinguishers of light”; with the
Yezêds and Dushikkurds, who celebrate nocturnal religious orgies which
end in a wild sexual debauch, during which incestuous unions also occur.
(Spiegel: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erân. Altertumskunde</span>,” II, p. 64.) Further examples are
to be found in the valuable work of Stoll (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Sexualleben in der

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f753'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r753'>753</a>. Concerning the kiss of the snake, compare Grimm, II, p. 809.
By this means, a beautiful woman was set free. The sucking refers to
the maternal significance of the snake, which exists along with the
phallic. It is a coitus act on the presexual stage. Spielrein’s insane
patient (<cite>Jahrbuch</cite>, III, p. 344) says as follows: “Wine is the blood of
Jesus.—The water must be blessed, and was blessed by him. The one
buried alive becomes the vineyard. That wine becomes blood—the
water is mingled with ‘childishness’ because God says, ‘become like
little children.’ There is also a spermatic water which can be drunken
with blood. That perhaps is the water of Jesus.” Here we find a
commingling of all the various meanings of the way to win immortality.
Wiedemann (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der alte Orient</span>,” II, 2, p. 18; cited by Dieterich: Ibid.,
p. 101) asserts that it is an Egyptian idea that man draws in the milk
of immortality by suckling the breast of a goddess. (Compare with that
the myth of Hercules, where the hero attains immortality by a single
draw at the breast of Hera.)</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r757'>757</a>. The significance of the communion ritual as a unio mystica with
God is at bottom sexual and very corporeal. The primitive significance
of the communion is that of a Hierosgamos. Therefore in the fragment
of the Attis mysteries handed down by Firmicus it is said that the mystic
eats from the Tympanon, drinks from the Kymbalon, and he confesses:
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ τὸν παστὸν ὑπέδυον</span>, which means the same as: “I have entered the
bridal chamber.” Usener (in Dieterich: Ibid., p. 126) refers to a series of
quotations from the patristic literature, of which I mention merely one
sentence from the speeches of Proclus of Constantinople: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡ παστας εν ἡ
ὁ λογος ενυμφευσατο την σακρα</span> (The bridal chamber in which the Logos has
espoused the flesh). The church is also to some extent the bridal chamber,
where the spirit unites with the flesh, really the Cömeterium. Irenaeus
mentions some more of the initiatory customs of certain gnostic sects,
which were undoubtedly nothing but spiritual weddings. (Compare
Dieterich: Ibid., p. 127 ff.) In the Catholic church, even yet, a Hierosgamos
is celebrated on the installation of a priest. A young maiden there
represents the church as bride.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r776'>776</a>. Just as is Mânî so is Marsyas a crucified one. (See Robertson:
“Evangelical Myths,” p. 66.) Both were hung, a punishment which has
an unmistakable symbolic value, because the suspension (“to suffer
and fear in the torment of suspension”) is the symbol of an unfulfilled
wish. (See Freud: “The Interpretation of Dreams.”) Therefore Christ,
Odin, Attis hung on trees (= mother). The Talmudic Jesus ben Pandira
(apparently the earliest historic Jesus) suffered a similar death, on
the eve of a Passover festival in the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (106–79
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>). This Jesus may have been the founder of the “Essenes,” a sect
(see Robertson: “Evang. Myths,” p. 123) which stood in a certain relation
to subsequent Christianity. The Jesus ben Stada identified with the preceding
Jesus, but removed into the second Christian century, was also
hung. Both were first stoned, a punishment which was, so to speak,
a bloodless one like hanging. The Christian church, which spills no
blood, therefore burned. This may not be without significance for a
peculiar ceremony reported from Uganda: “When a king of Uganda
wished to live forever, he went to a place in Busiro, where a feast was
given by the chiefs. At the feast the Mamba Clan was especially held
in honor, and during the festivities a member of this clan was secretly
chosen by his fellows, caught by them, and beaten to death with their
fists; no stick or other weapon might be used by the men appointed to
do the deed. After death, the victim’s body was flayed and the skin
made into a special whip, etc. After the ceremony of the feast in
Busiro, with its strange sacrifice, the king of Uganda was supposed to
live forever, but from that day he was never allowed to see his mother
again.” (Quoted from Frazer: “Golden Bough,” Part IV, p. 415.) The
sacrifice, which is chosen to purchase everlasting life for another, is here
given over to a bloodless death and after that skinned. That this sacrifice
has an absolutely unmistakable relation to the mother—as we
already know—is corroborated very plainly by Frazer.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r782'>782</a>. Another attempt at solution seems to be the Dioscuri motive:
The sun consists of two brothers similar to each other, the one mortal,
the other immortal. This motive is found, as is well known, in the
two Açvins, who, however, are not further differentiated. In the
Mithraic doctrine, Mithra is the father, Sol the son, and yet both are
one as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ μέγας θεὸς Ἥελιος Μίθρας</span>. The motive of twins emerges, not infrequently,
in dreams. In a dream, where it is related that a woman had
given birth to twins, the dreamer found, instead of the expected children,
a box and a bottle-like object. Here the twins had male and female
significance. This observation hints at a possible significance of the
Dioscuri as the sun and its re-bearing mother—daughter (?).</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r785'>785</a>. This problem has frequently been employed in the ancient sun
myths. It is especially striking that the lion-killing heroes, Samson and
Hercules, are weaponless in the combat. The lion is the symbol of the
most intense summer heat, astrologically he is the Domicilium Solis.
Steinthal (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie</span></cite>, Vol. II, p. 133) reasons
about this in a most interesting manner, which I quote word for word:</p>

<p class='c007'>“When the Sun-god fights against the summer heat, he fights against
himself; when he kills it, he kills himself. Most certainly! The
Phœnician, Assyrian and Lydian ascribes self-destruction to his sun-god,
for he can comprehend the lessening of the sun’s heat only as a self-murder.
He believed that the sun stood at its highest in the summer
and its rays scorched with destroying heat: thus does the god burn
himself, but he does not die, only rejuvenates himself.—Also Hercules
burns himself, but ascends to Olympus in the flames. This is the contradiction
in the pagan gods. They, as forces of nature, are helpful
as well as harmful to men. In order to do good and to redeem they
must work against themselves. The opposition is dulled, when either
of the two sides of the forces of nature is personified in an especial
god, or when the power of nature is conceived of as a divine personage;
however, each of its two modes of action, the benevolent and the injurious,
has an especial symbol. The symbol is always independent, and
finally is the god himself; and while originally the god worked against
himself, destroyed himself, now symbol fights against symbol, god
against god, or the god with the symbol.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Certainly the god fights with himself, with his other self, which we
have conceived of under the symbol of mother. The conflict always
appears to be the struggle with the father and the conquering of the
mother.</p>

the remarks in the first part of this work, especially that mystic identification
with the stars: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εγω ειμι συμπλανος ὑμιν αστερ</span> (I am a star who wanders
together with you). The separation and differentiation from the
mother, the “individuation” creates that transition of the subjective into
the objective, that foundation of consciousness. Before this, man was
one with the mother. That is to say, with the world as a whole. At
that period man did not know the sun as brother. This occurred for
the first time, when after the resulting separation and placing of the
object, the libido, regressing to the infantile, perceived in that first state
its possibilities and the suspicion of his relationship to the stars forced
itself upon him. This occurrence appears not infrequently in the introversion
psychoses. A young peasant, an ordinary laboring man, developed
an introversion psychosis (Dementia Praecox). His first feelings
of illness were shown by a special connection which he felt with the
sun and the stars. The stars became full of meaning to him, and the
sun suggested ideas to him. This apparently entirely new perception of
nature is met with very often in this disease. Another patient began
to understand the language of birds, which brought him messages from
his beloved (mother). Compare Siegfried.</p>

given him, and man is disinclined to obtain it once more for himself,
because it is won only through “toil and compulsion”: even love costs
trouble. In childhood the well of the libido gushed forth in bubbling
fulness. In later life it involves hard work to even keep the stream
flowing for the onward striving life, because with increasing age the
stream has a growing inclination to flow back to its source, if effectual
mechanisms are not created to hinder this backward movement or at
least to organize it. In this connection belongs the generally accepted
idea, that love is absolutely spontaneous; only the infantile type of love
is something absolutely spontaneous. The love of an adult man allows
itself to be purposefully directed. Man can also say “I will love.” The
heights of culture are conditioned by <em>the capacity for displacement of
the libido</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r843'>843</a>. A similar sacrificial death is that of Prometheus. He was chained
to a rock. In another version his chains were drawn through a pillar,
which hints at the enchainment to a tree. That punishment was his
which Christ took upon himself willingly. The fate of Prometheus
therefore recalls the misfortune of Theseus and Peirithoos, who remain
bound to the rock, the chthonic mother. According to Athenaeus, Jupiter
commanded Prometheus, after he had freed him, to wear a willow
crown and an iron ring, by which his lack of freedom and slavery was
symbolically represented. (Phoroneus, who in Argos was worshipped as
the bringer of fire, was the son of Melia, the ash, therefore tree-enchained.)
Robertson compares the crown of Prometheus to the crown of
thorns of Christ. The devout carry crowns in honor of Prometheus, in
order to represent the captivity (“Evangelical Myths,” p. 126). In this
connection, therefore, the crown means the same as the betrothal ring.
These are the requisites of the old Hierosgamos with the mother; the
crown of thorns (which is of Egyptian derivation according to
Athenaeus) has the significance of the painful ascetic betrothal.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f846'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r846'>846</a>. Mention must also be made of the fact that North German mythology

Odin obtained knowledge of the Runes and the inspiring, intoxicating
drink which invested him with immortality.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f847'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r847'>847</a>. I have refrained in the course of this merely orienting investigating
from referring to the countless possibilities of relationship between dream
symbolism and the material disclosed in these connections. That is a
matter of a special investigation. But I cannot forbear mentioning here
a simple dream, the first which a youthful patient brought to me in the
beginning of her analysis. “She stands between high walls of snow
upon a railroad track with her small brother. A train comes, she runs
before it in deadly fear and leaves her brother behind upon the track.
She sees him run over, but after the train has passed, the little fellow
stands up again uninjured.” The meaning of the dream is clear: the
inevitable approach of the “impulse.” The leaving behind of the little
brother is the repressed willingness to accept her destiny. The acceptance
is symbolized by the sacrifice of the little brother (the infantile
personality) whose apparently certain death becomes, however, a resurrection.
Another patient makes use of classical forms: she dreamed of
a mighty eagle, which is wounded in beak and neck by an arrow. If
we go into the actual transference phantasy (eagle = physician, arrow =
erotic wish of the patient), then the material concerning the eagle (winged
lion of St. Mark, the past splendor of Venice; beak = remembrances of
certain perverse actions of childhood) leads us to understand the eagle
as a composition of infantile memories, which in part are grouped
around the father. The eagle, therefore, is an infantile hero who is
wounded in a characteristic manner on the phallic point (beak). The
dream also says: I renounce the infantile wish, I sacrifice my infantile
personality (which is synonymous with: I paralyze it, castrate the father
or the physician). In the Mithra mysteries, in the introversion the
mystic himself becomes <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀετός</span>, the eagle, this being the highest degree of
initiation. The identification with the unconscious libido animal goes
very far in this cult, as Augustine relates: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">alii autem sicut aves alas percutiunt
vocem coracis imitantes, alii vero leonum more fremunt</span>” (Some
move the arms like birds the wings, imitating the voice of the raven,
some groan like lions).</p>

In “Psychology of Dementia Praecox,” p. 161, she says: “Then a
little green snake came into my mouth; it had the finest, loveliest sense,
as if it had human understanding; it wanted to say something to me,
almost as if it had wished to kiss me.” Spielrein’s patient says of the
snake: “It is an animal of God, which has such wonderful colors, green,
blue and white. The rattlesnake is green; it is very dangerous. The
snake can have a human mind, it can have God’s judgment; it is a
friend of children. It will save those children who are necessary for
the preservation of human life” (<cite>Jahrbuch</cite>, Vol. III, p. 366). Here the
phallic meaning is unmistakable. The snake as the transformed prince
in the fairy tale has the same meaning. See Riklin: “Wish Fulfilment
and Symbolism in Fairy Tales.”</p>

(quieting the child by whistling and snapping). Of similar
significance is the roaring at the divinity. (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mithr. Lit.</span>,” p. 13): “You
are to look at him and give forth a long roar, as with a horn, using all
your breath, pressing your sides, and kiss the amulet&nbsp;... etc.” “My
soul roars with the voice of a hungry lion,” says Mechthild von Magdeburg.
“As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
after God.”—<cite>Psalms</cite> xlii: 2. The ceremonial custom, as so often happens,
has dwindled into a figure of speech. Dementia praecox, however,
revivifies the old custom, as in the “Roaring miracle” of Schreber. See
the latter’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken</span>,” by which he demands
that God, i.e. the Father, so inadequately oriented with humanity,
take notice of his existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The infantile reminiscence is clear, that is, the childish cry to attract
the attention of the parent to himself; the whistling and smacking for the
allurement of the theriomorphic attribute, the “helpful animal.” (See
Rank: “The Myth of the Birth of the Hero.”)</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
